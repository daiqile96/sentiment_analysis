__label__2 compatible toner cartridge for HP 12A: This B&W toner cartridge is acceptable as a replacement cartridge for HP 12A. Its copies are of standard quality and the price is right.
__label__2 Perfect for those that love bakery breads!: This toaster is so perfect! I could not be happier. As someone who prefers self-cut and bakery breads versus the puffy white stuff, this toaster is ideal. There is a dial to set toasting to perfection, and even a button for frozen bread (which is great for those, like me, who often keep their bread in the freezer). It also toasts bagels, English muffins (even the nice big thick ones!) and toaster pastries with ease and to perfection. A great buy at a good price for value. We've had this toaster over 2 years and no complaints!
__label__1 Warning: This may not be what you think it is.: These recording were NOT made in the 50's; according to AMG they are re-recordings of his best known music and it was recorded in the 70's. For me, that spoils the fun.
__label__2 Easy to Use: I bought 4 and gave two to friends and keep extras for all my running shoes. The holder is very easy to apply to your shoe -- fits easily under the laces and is secure when you run. Just add your Sport Sensor -- it fits nice and secure into the pouch and you're ready to go!
__label__2 A MUST HAVE!: I am not one for writing reviews. Just in it for the music. Dance With Angels is FANTASTIC! You pass on this CD and it is your loss.
__label__1 A whole lot of fluff and a little bit of information!: While this has the potential to be a decent series, it bombards you with advertising for itself constantly. Presented in a 6 week study format, even from the "scence selection" option it forces you to watch, yet again, a commercial-like introduction for the Deeper Connections series. After getting through 4 weeks of this, and all of us knowing the theme song in the commercial, we had enough and banished it to the closet and started in on a new Rob Bell video.If you can make it though the commercials weekly, you then get to listen to a dramatic reading of the scripture, followed by some decent reflections from different theologians. The content isn't that bad but probably only amounts to about 40% of the actual DVD, the rest is just fluff!By the way, if you haven't tried Rob Bell, he's great! We always have the most people in attendance when we announce that we will be using his DVD's.
__label__2 NOT A MOVIE FOR AN AVERAGE PERSON: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SF MOVIES OF THE LAST 5 YEARS . BUT WAIT , IT IS NOT FOR THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT EASY AND FORGETS ABOUT THE MOVIE AFTER IT ENDS.THIS MOVIE IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND NEITHER TO OVERLOOK. IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND ENERGY TO START A PERSONAL EVALUATION AFTER IT FINISH, BUY IT AN ENJOY.
__label__1 Why buy this when a block of professional rosin is only a few dollars more?: I am a music teacher and can tell you that rosin matters to your sound even as a beginner. Move up and pay $8-$12 for something that really makes a difference. It will last forever if you don't drop it.
__label__1 PLEASE Read The Fugitive Game after you read this book!: This book is pretty boring. The pages and pages of details about Tsumoto's life really get to you after awhile. His arrogance is only matched by his determination that we the reader not think of him as a computer nerd. If you have the stamina read this book then read The Fugitive Game for a more accurate story and so much more interesting.
__label__2 Works well: Its not the lightess air gun out there or the quietest but it gets the job done. It gets used multiple times a day for lug nuts and has had no issues.
__label__1 This Movie is a Legend: I believe this movie will go down as causing the end of the 90's teen slasher movies. It was absolutely awful! Horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible attempts at comedy. I felt no pity for the victims because we never really got a chance to know them. This movie is an insult to the first Urban Legend movie and makes it look like a masterpiece
__label__1 Not Ballads At All: I was quite excited about getting this album because I am a big fan of Folk Ballads. However, this album really has no ballads on it. This album consists of up-beat songs that really don't have any heart behind them like the title would lead you to believe. I suggest listening to samples before purchasing this album. Also, this album really does not have much musical depth it is basically just vocals and banjo (or guitar sometimes).
__label__2 First Impression: I'm still ... out about Entombed. I got Wolerine Blues in the mail today, and when i put it in my cd player i was totally blown away. This band is heavy, and i mean heavy, the Swedish people know how to play their heavy metal. The reason i got this cd was i saw a video by Meshuggah and the drummer had their shirt on and i've seen great reviews about them. So i thought what the hell i'll give them a shot, and boy am i glad i did. If you like heavy riffs and deep vocals this is the ... band for you.
__label__2 Beautiful watch!: Purchased this watch for the wife some time ago and she never wears watches (and always asks me for the time). The materials are top notch and Citizen has really hit a home run with their Eco-Drive series watches. I prefer this technology over the Seiko Kinetic which gets bothersome after a while shaking. I purchased this watch after purchasing a Calibre 2100 Citizen titanium for myself.If you go with this watch you will have a timepiece that will last for years and never need a battery!!
__label__1 Sorry but this version did nothing for me: I know people are tired of hearing how remakes are bad and originals are best, but in most cases it's true I was not effected by the 2005 version at all, sure Ryan Reynolds is fun to look at, and the acting in the film was great, but the story changes, and the ambiance through out the film was not as creepy as the older 1979 version, in fact I was so bored half way through that I nearly lost track of what was happening, by the way I watched the film on cable uncut and commercial free so I was able to view this snooser in it's full non glory lol, just didn't like it at all just have to be honestI still feel that the 1979 version starring Margot Kidder and James Brolin is best out of all other Amityville films made so far. Well on a good note the the newest version is in wide-screen format and it's a special edition and also in blu-ray format so that's a plus for those of you who enjoyed this version. thanks for reading my opinion.
__label__2 The Passion is the Best!: In this excitiong conclusion to The Dark Visions Trilogy Gabriel has left and joined up with Mr. Zetes. But Kait knows this isn't the real Gabriel. So she decides to save him. She leaves the group and pretends to team up with Zetes. But while there Kait starts exploring her feelings and realizes she is crazy in love and holds a deep burning passion for...Gabriel. Can Kait save the day? And who will she chose? Rob or Gabriel? The light or the dark?Kaitlyn definately made the right choice!!! This was my favorite of the trilogy. It was AWESOME! Make sure you read this and all of L.J.'s other books.
__label__2 Persuasion..1971: Most complete and true to the novel treatment. No captions available which makes it hard to understand at times. Great for die-hard Austen fans.
__label__1 Brief review: Apparently, Robert Altman is only interested in watching his actors move: during ballet performances, ballet practice -- even outside of the ballet company (i.e. the relationship between a ballet dancer and a chef is more action-oriented than talky). There's very little talking and very, very little character development, purposely, sadly. (You know as much about the characters here as you know about the people performing in a ballet play.) The Company is really a silent film with a few droplets of dialogue -- a joke if you ask me. Unfortunately, I was never engaged by the performances (the first one came close, though). Fans of ballet should get something out of it, though.
__label__2 Pretty good: I wasn't expecting much from this book since i tried to read some of tim green's stuff before and for some reason, didn't care for any of those. However, when i heard that it was essentially a remake of Count of Monte Cristo, I knew i had to read it. I loved count of monte cristo since i was a kid and i have to say that tim green adapts the story very well. It will definately keep you intrigued. There was a few weak spots but overall, very enjoyable.
__label__1 Years Later, Its Still "So So" Than Yes: I remember and still have the vinyl album when it came out. The first cut I heard was 'Tempis Fugit'. Knowing the "buggling" addition to the group, I was strapped in for a ride of sorts. The above cut and 'Does It Really Happen' are the best on the CD. The rest is just dribble. A star for each!
__label__1 Too slow moving to watch for me: It was beautiful at times, and then it slowed down to a craw. Too, too, slow moving.Beautiful and at times interesting
__label__1 Big Disappointment: I hate to say this because I think Malcolm Bilson is an excellent pianist and I thoroughly enjoy and recommend his recording of the Mozart concertos with John Eliot Gardiner, but this CD was a big disappointment. Not because of Bilson's playing (which is very good) but for the awful recording quality of the CD. Sounds like they put the piano in a public restroom to record some of these sonatas. It has a very harsh "small room" reverberation that is very unappealing and uncomplimentary to the fortepiano (or any instrument!). Bilson deserves better enginneering than this. This would be a good CD if it were better recorded. Bilson's performance is fine , but the recording quality is unbearable. I recommend Melvyn Tan if you are looking for a good recording and performance of Beethoven sonatas on fortepiano.
__label__1 Buyer beware: Put your money in a good gas generator, then you won't have to deal with a E03 message from the Xantrex Power Source 1800.
__label__2 Another winner in Wolf's Chicago Blues Session series: I saw L V Banks the first time I went to the legendary Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago, the last of the old-time South Side blues clubs. I was mesmorized by the intimate surroundings at the place and just the overall experience of it all; so much different (then, anyway) than the yuppie-infested blues bars downtown. Which, of course, made this an easy sell for Amazon. But although Banks may not be well-known outside Chicago, this is pretty good Chicago slide-guitar blues, aided by Allan Batts' piano in the studio recordings. His voice may remind some people of Taj Mahal's. Best tracks are "Hard to Love A Woman", "I Love My Guitar" and "Pipe Layer". If you like Chicago blues, this album is recommended. Chicago-based Wolf Records, in fact, has a very comprehensive set of CDs called "The Chicago Blues Session" featuring local artists, of which this one is part, that you may want to check out if you're really passionate about Chicago blues.
__label__2 Excellent follow-up!: Truly speaking, Fiona Apple must be the female version of Beck. Fusing all kinds of grooves and rhythm into her impeccable music on this album, listenin to When The Pawn is like continuing from where she left us off on Tidal. Sounding more mature with less anguish, Fiona adds a jazz touch to her songs which covers both depth and artistry. Whereas other similar age-group females are crooning teeny-bopper stuff, Fiona is truly and definitely more mature and endearing. EXCELLENT tracks include To Your Love, Paper Bag, Mistake, Fast As You Can and The Way Things Are. The twists and turns are especially unexpected in the 1st single FAST AS YOU CAN! You go girl!
__label__1 Braun PowerMax Blender: We bought this blender because it was recommended by Consumer Reports as a very good smoothie blender. We were very disappointed in how it performed and in Consumer Reports' recommendation. It wasn't able to crush regular-sized ice cubes for smoothies. Recently we bought a 600W Cuisinart blender/food processor that does a really nice job with regular-sized ice cubes and the food processor is a nice bonus!
__label__1 Incomplete Movie!!!: The disc only contained half the movie and kicked back to the menu after scene 23 (Where Mozart conducts the opera he wrote for his deceased father). I tried to select the scene where it cut out and that's all that's on the disc. What a jip!!!! I want my money back.
__label__1 moon sand a waste of money: my daughter wanted this so badly!she begged and begged. we finally agreed,not knowing exactly how it was going to be. do not waste your money! buy some nice play sand for a sand box instead. add water. buy some molds and cookie cutters. or go to the beach for free! this stuff was a mess! most of it ended up in the trash. my 6 yr. old is neat,but this was all over her! i asked her if it was worth it to her and she said it was fun,but she has not asked to use it again.
__label__2 Prelutsky is wonderful for kids and adults.: Several years after reading this book, I can still recall by heart many of Prelutsky's clever rhymes and catchy rhythms. The amazing thing is: so can my kids! The favorite dinosaurs such as T-Rex are given their poetic due, but so are lesser known dinosaurs such as leptoterigius and quetzelcoatlus. (sp?) Although I love all of Prelutsky's whimsical poetry, I felt this book was better suited for young listeners than such works as "It's Snowing! It's Snowing". (Perhaps because the subject matter is more familiar to the pre-school set) Some parents may not like the occasional graphic imagery, but lets face it: carniverous dinosaurs were not dainty eaters! The poetry is too lyrical to be truly gruesome, and besides, all kids like to be grossed out a little bit. If your child is at all into dinosaurs, this may be a good addition to your home library.
__label__2 A Great Book ! The first in a Great Series!: Honor Donovan and Jake Mallory set the pages on fire with their fiery personalities and passion but both are afraid to trust and love. It was a great adventure with plenty of action, 'shady' characters and love scenes. Elizabeth Lowell really writes wonderful books, but I have one complaint. The endings to all her stories come so quickly that I feel I'd like to know just a little more, like a short epilogue about the wedding or honeymoon, etc., something so that I don't feel like I'm left hanging. I have read all the Donovan stories in this series that she has written so far and they are all GREAT! I'm looking forward to the last two brothers' (Lawe & Justin) stories. If you like a good romance with lots of action, suspense and steamy love scenes, you'll love this book and all the others in the series.
__label__2 Excellent!: A detailed fictional story with strong true historical background. I learned much more about the beginnings of the American Revolution than I ever did in school. This is the first of several books in this series, all of which are so very well written.
__label__1 The graphics are horrible: The graphics on my dads Original Atari system from the 80's are better than the graphics on this remake. I expected better from a playstation game. I love Tetris, but this version is horrible.Save your money.
__label__1 Poorly designed & not universal at all: I own three late model vehicles & with tremendous effrot was only able to install in one vehicle. The installation in that vehicle proved to be incapable of withstanding the slightest bump without falling from its location. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
__label__2 Beautiful: It is beautiful a little smaller than I thought but no problem. The pendant is very well done very delicate. I gave it to my mother and she loved it.
__label__2 Game B9y Advance SP Pro Gamers Kit - Cobalt: This is a great case that comes with the accessories you need for travel and privacy.
__label__2 Great Music: I generally hate it when singers attempt to sing '60's and '70's Motown that were not a part of the Organization during that era. However, MM is an exception. He offers his own style without taking the funk and soul out of the music like many other pop artists, namely Mike Bolton and Linda Ronstadt, are notorious of doing.He delivers very powerful heart thumping vocals that are impossible for any singer to replicate. His opener, "Heard it Thru the Grapevine," set the stage for some great rhythms with terrific instruments and background singers throughout the track. "Ain't no Mountain" is another great rendition by him. Usually, no matter how great the record, there are at least one or two bad songs but such doesn't appear to be the case here.Michael McDonald has released one of the top CD's of the year.
__label__2 Great size: Very good quality, very good price. Well packaged. I love the disign very chick!! I bought for my sisters and they love it..
__label__1 Horrible product this year: I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year. What a fool I was. This years program was a nightmare. I will never purchase it again. Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted. Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time. It got to the point I quit going back to check. It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct. I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend. Next year I will try a different product. ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult. There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing. I could never figure out where I was. Thanks for the headache Turbotax.
__label__2 Good doesn't have to be expensive: These are great. I use them all the time for monitoring when recording. I'm sure there are some better cans out there, but I've found these to be really solid, balanced, and true. The only thing bad about them is after several years of use, the leather-like covers on the earphones are flaking off (though the foam underneath is still fine). So I'm going to buy a new pair. They have a nice long cord, and you can wear them comfortably for a long, long time. They're light but sturdy.
__label__1 not enough resistance: the resistance tops out because it gets so hot that the disk can't generate enough eddy currents to provide the needed resistance. That is to say, the longer and harder you pedal, the easier it gets! They need to design more cooling into the device.
__label__1 What a disappointment!: My husband and I watched this entire movie, and when it was over, neither of us knew what we had seen. Having never read it, I can only hope the book is better than the screenplay.
__label__2 fantastic!!!: I love this mixer!! I started with the kitchenaid 4 1/2quart mixer which was great but I was making a wedding cake and needed a bigger mixer. I mixes an amazing amount of batter. It does have a more metalic sound than my other mixer. I got the meringue color and it is beautiful. It has a pearly finish. The picture does not do it justice.
__label__1 Piece of junk: Might work for a donut (I don't eat them) but not for anything tougher (like whole wheat bread). Pre-glued pieces fell apart as I was putting the rest together. Returned one, kept the other after reinforcing it with screws and duct tape becasue I don't want to go through this again with another model.
__label__1 Not the greatest: I ordered this product during a heavy infestation in my house. I hoped that using this, along with treating my animals, vaccuming daily, and having the pest control people spray, that the problem would be solved. That was three months ago. I am still seeing fleas. My children are being bitten. And the trap has not caught one single flea.
__label__1 A shallow conversation: Too short, too one sided (Jesus dominates the conversation). Worst of all it is a lecture by Jesus to Buddha filled with Bible quotations, not a conversation between equals, and a bit patronizing.
__label__1 Ummmmmmmmmmmmm: Ok, I am an avid book reader, but I have to admit, I was not impressed with this book. I read it while in a book club with some people at my school and I felt my interest fade within three days of starting it. I mean, it was a good enough plot, but I just felt my enthusiasm fade.
__label__1 Oh my...: I wanted to see this movie because I like Mickey Rourke and I heart Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In fact, Levitt is pretty much the only reason I watched it to the end. This movie turned me off from the very beginning with Rourke playing some sort of evil character reminiscent of a naughty Steven Seagal. I thought we left all of the Caucasian mock NDNs back in the 1990s!The plot of this movie was pretty nonsensical. There wasn't enough action nor wit to distract the viewer (if only momentarily) from the hole-ridden plot. There were a few mildly surprising scenes in the movie, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. If you're bored and home alone on a Friday night, there's no harm in watching this. However, it's seriously not worth having on DVD.
__label__1 Only received 9 blankets...: I suppose these are ok (I haven't used them) however, I only received 9 of the 10 and they aren't in a 'pack' they are just thrown into a box individually.
__label__2 Las Vegas, De Niro, Pecsi....Whats not to love?: A great movie and a great DVD. Other than Goodfellas, this movie is tops. The acting is great, with unexpected great performances from Sharon Stone and James Woods. Just wish they offered a Pan & Scan version.
__label__1 Broken in 24 hours: After reading all the rave reviews of this product, I thought that finally I had found a product that could give my daughter's cat (and us) an odor free environment. Well, guess again. I ordered this product brand-new from Amazon, and installed it following the simple instruction. It worked well initially, and stopped working within the first day. The rake stopped at the other end, and the green light was still on (which supposedly means it is operating well). I pressed the homing button. Nothing happened. Tried all the stuff recommended by the manual. Nothing happened. In the end, I had to take the old litter box out and re-educated the cat to go back there. Very frustrating experience indeed. Hope you will be prepared when you are ready to make the purchase...
__label__2 Just one word; genius.: Being both a mechanical engineer and an absolute lover of physics, I have few words to describe what this book means. This book is simply the bible of field theory inthis world. However is not to everyone, it is a very hard book, rigorous mathematically talking, profound and definitive, this is that kind of book you only catch up and face it when you have a rigorous and a considerable knowledge of both physics and advanced calculus, obviously if you have neither one nor other, you'd better get another text, maybe an intermediate one. It is interesting that it starts with special relativity and finishes with general relativity; you'd better be good in tensor calculus. Landau left a legacy unequaled in terms of theoretical physics; all of his books on this series are way above average and absolutely definitive texts in theoretical physics.
__label__1 Disappointing: Not what I expected at all. The writing style is hard to follow, the story itself appears to be very compelling but I really got tired of trying to work out what the author was trying to put across, there were just so many names, after half I just gave up.
__label__2 A Little Tenderness: This one ain't for everybody. It takes patience to view, and trust that Vincent Gallo won't let you down. He doesn't. The ending surprises, the in-between challenges and intrigues the viewer, and there is an overall theme of tenderness that was a very pleasant surprise. AND LASTLY, I am thankful for it- it's not some self-absorbed indie flick nor some piece of shiny, plastic Hollywood studio crap. Yes, I know it's a movie, but it's effect was to feel very real - and ain't that "movie magic"?
__label__1 It is not a real-world product: I bought this product, tried and tried. It did not work. Maybe it will work if the surrounding interference drops to zero.
__label__2 Good quality hose: You probably don't want a 3/4" hose for watering the plants and whatnot, but for sprinklers and other applications where you want a lot of flow and don't drag the hose around too much it is ideal. I bought one of these to replace a 5/8" hose from the local garden center that runs across our driveway to a big sprinkler. The old hose was a few years old and finally cracked where we drive over it. This one has been there for about 6 months now and shows no sign of breaking down so far.
__label__1 Now we know what became of Lucas Electrical Works: Someone earlier compared this product to a Jaguar, and I would agree - a Jaguar from the '60's with Lucas wiring harness. Mine looks great; used gently and with terrific results for about two years, then suddenly - no heat. Krups repair took about five weeks, and it was as wonderful as the day it was purchased. Today, after similar gentle use six months after the repair - same symptoms. It will not see the inside of the shop again. It is destined for the crusher. I'm pleased, at least, that I acquired it on sale for less than $25 as a loss leader. The repair also cost $25.
__label__1 Bends easily and has sharp edges: I wanted to use this product for my wireless keyboard and mouse while sitting in the recliner.Incredibly, just the weight of the keyboard, a mousepad, and a mouse are enough to warp the board so the keyboard actually bounces as you type (because it is not touching the surface on all corners). There is no comfortable way to use the mouse because of the sharp edges digging into your arm. In addition the cutouts for carrying the board around are in the worst possible place, taking away a lot (LOT!) of useful space on the surface.I tried using this for a writing surface while sitting on a couch, and encountered exactly the same problems.This product is useless to me.With these modifications it would be very useful:* Thicker, so it doesn't bend so easily.* Round off those sharp edges!* Cut-out for carrying at TOP, not on BOTH SIDES.
__label__2 Mickey Waffler is GREAT!!!!: I recently bought the Mickey Wafflemaker for my wife. She saw it being used down at Disney World and fell in love with it. She was so excited when we got. She has been making Mickey waffles every weekend since. The wafffler is well made and works very well. I highly recommend this product.
__label__1 Torture: I don't get it. After reading and re-reading Neverwhere(one of my all time favorites) I anxiously looked forward to Gods. What a disappointment. I forced myself to finish it, figuring it would soon pick up a bit. Never did. Too cute, too convoluted, basically unreadable. Can't wait to get to something more interesting (although The Pennysaver would be) after wasting 2 weeks.
__label__1 it WILL crack! not a matter of chance here.: his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason. I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough, which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball), don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service, don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise, and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity.
__label__2 Great....... Well Written: This book was really good, I loved the twists and turns that the author allows the character to take. I will be honest, I was moved the most attowared the end of the novel. I would recommend this one for any book club, even Oprah's
__label__1 "Specks of dust" on photo scans: Photo Scanning: Every Color Photo that I scanned resulted in images that looked like there were little specks of dust on the image. Yes, I changed the setting that purports to remedy this issue, but it did not adequately correct this problem.Setup: Straightforward, documented and easySpeed: Not as long as I had anticipated for a 4x6 photo, based on the other commentsNoise level: Its noisier than my old Umax, but not overly soSize/Appearance: Nearly perfect, if you do not need legal size scanning
__label__2 preconceptions smashed: I just knew he had some crazy meditation techniques was a bit of a rogue, had 93 rolls royces, accepted sex and i had a few friends who recommended him. Wow, blown away, this is one of the most beautiful books i've ever read! Osho's integrity shines through and yes he is a dangerous man because he's not concerned about beliefs but the truth. And he challenges you deeply, i was a buddhist monk for 3 years and he takes traditions apart 'Buddha wasn't a buddhist' what a one liner. Many buddhist books seem to take a mathematical approach to enlightenment, Osho is a poet. I just cried reading this book, with laughter and joy and hope, i even found myself clapping and shouting 'Yes yes yes!' Sheer delight. I'm hooked.love and peace
__label__2 Great book!: Lovely appliqué. I don't use their Piece 'O Cake style of appliqué (I use back basting), but I truly love the patterns.
__label__2 Jackson writes a good book: Not a complete reference by any means but a great book. Shares allot of content with another book on amazon because it is an older version so i ended up giving the older copy to friend.I actually bought this to study for the cicerone exam and am disappointed to mention that I did not pass needed to know more about kegging tapping and maintenance of tap and keg systems.nailed the styles though and that's what this covers.
__label__1 What a waste!: Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched "The Doors" too many times. What a waste, another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career. I'd recommend buying any album from Nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows.
__label__2 Not a miss yet: I bought this book 4 years ago when I first went vegan and I still reach for it regularly. I have yet to try a recipe that did not work, which is more than I can say for some other vegan/gluten-free cookbooks. I just wish the author would give us another one!
__label__1 Not So Vicious: After reading Mr. O'Brien's Vicious, this was a complete let down. Disappointed that I actually paid for it. It is slow paced and a lot of things are drawn out till you're bored to tears. It barely focuses on the killer so you can't even guess who it might be. I recommend Vicious and Final Breath but no Make Them Cry. Truly truly disappointed.
__label__1 Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldJP: I Didn`t like it because it makes me feel bad when I read about responsibility. It is also about family value and I like that. So, I give this book three stars.
__label__1 Horrible Movie: This is a typical over advertised piece of trash movie. The effects were good but a computer did that ! They lied more about this movie then Obama did in the last 2 years. Save your money !!! you'll need it for taxes.
__label__2 If I had to choose: I teach special education and if someone were to say to me, "You can only have one book to help you in the classroom, what book do you want?" I would choose, Tough Kids Tool Box. I had loaned this book to a fellow teacher and she thought she had lost it. I was frantic, trying to find another copy. Luckily we located mine. I no longer loan it. I recommend it to all teachers, fresh out of college or the veteran.
__label__2 Excellent CD: This CD has all of John Schneiders greatest hits in his relatively short career. Most of the songs on this album are ballads and they are very good. I would recommend this CD to anyone who was a fan of country music in the 1980's.
__label__1 Maybe I'm just unlucky but mine was a dud: I bought mine when they first came out and at its most expensive cost...I got to charge my iPod 5 times and the charger completely died on me. I bought another from a different brand, used and under $5 on top of it and have had no problems whatsoever and I use it frequently. I was very dissatisfied and unimpressed with this Griffin model.
__label__1 Building Heidi: The plans are often inaccurate, e,g,. measurements for the temporary backbone are way off. The plank marks on the stem make no sense. Over size lumber is called for wasting a lot of money.I emailed Wooden Boat as no one was listed for help but never received an answer. Definately not for the first time builder.
__label__1 "Gentle Yoga "needs visuals: The reason I gave "Gentle Yoga" only two stars is because it is only audio. I neglected to see that when I ordered. If it had picture it would be much easier to follow. With only audio it was hard for me to understand and visualize the poses.
__label__1 For Club Members Only: The seven reviews of the film I have just read confirm what seeing the film suggested: one must be a member of the Club to make much sense of this production. What Club? As best I can make out, a reader of the original book or viewer of the other films in the series. I have done neither and found the film, oh, let us say, rather pointless, overblown and ludicrously pious.Of course, my hypothesis as to those who would enjoy this, may be entirely erroneous and my judgment simply poor taste. I put it down simply to indicate to some innocent potential viewer that not everyone was enamored of the film
__label__1 wasted my money: I ordered replacement ears after my husbands set just quit working - they did not work. There was nothing but buzzing in the headset. Had 2 other people look at them and nothing.
__label__1 Awful Iron: I have fought this iron for a year and now it's time to junk it, for 2 reasons.1. The temperature control button is on the front of the handle right where your hand goes. Without knowing, it's easy to push the button and change the temperature. If you're ironing something on low, you'll suddenly be ruining it on high. Put it on high and grab the iron a few times and you'll turn the power down to low.2. The spray button stopped working properly after 90 days. It would depress but not return. So, to get it to return, I would have to hit it with the palm of my hand several times. I have to do this several times throughout the process of ironing a shirt.It seems ridiculous to spend so much on an iron that doesn't function well. After having two Shark irons and a Shark vacuum, all of which functioned poorly, I'm done!
__label__2 Excellent Win98 Reference: I strongly recommend this book (and any other from the same series) to all who use Windows 98. The book has outstanding visual presentations of exactly what the Win98 screen shows and from there carries you step-by-step to completion of the majority of common tasks within the OS. SOme advanced functions are also included. I really like the series and recommend it regularly to friends and family.
__label__2 Whistling is worth whistling about!: Delightful to read and think through. This is an excellent novel set in the prarie lands of the US. Well worth reading - take it along on vacation this summer; you will be delighted you did.
__label__1 Long-winded and convoluted - Not helpful: This book suffers from poor writing and poor editing. The authors repeatedly restate information. Several examples and long-winded explanations are given when one example or explanation would be sufficient. Information given in one chapter is unnecessarily (and repeatedly) revisited in later chapters. The attempts at humor are not funny and come off as belittling to the subject at hand. I don't have a PhD., but I'm confident that I could come up with a better (and more comprehensible) plan for self-recovery than this book presents. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 brand new item like described netgear WGE111: EXCELLENT ITEM BUT I DIDN'T NEED IT. SO I RETURNED IT AND THIS COMPANY WAS GREAT DID THE RETURN NO PROBLEMS
__label__2 Great Product!: Great product! would recommend to put into your car as a part of your safety/survival kit. I love it! Get one
__label__2 When will the sequel be made?: A very interesting "historical" version! First, Richard I never spoke English! He was hit by a crossbow, but died in the arms of his mother. There was no "French invasion" by Phillip; the French did invade years later in John's reign when the Welsh and Scots also attacked English lands. The reference to the Barons Dispute did lead to war and then the signing of the Magna Cartr. Will the sequel focus on the heavy taxation of John to support his war? This will be central theme for "Robin Hood Part II" plus the First Baron's War and the loss of all land holdings of Normandy. Who will pardon and 'restore' Robin? King John died a broken and unloved failure in life. Ridley Scott will recreate English History again.
__label__2 Great Price!: My vet wanted this supplement for both my dogs. This is the same supplement at a good discount from my vet's price. Will be back again and again.
__label__2 totally enjoying this!: some of the reviews said that you "could" skip this vol and go to the 2nd part of this work, vol 2. after digesting this volume i am greatly thankFUL that i have ordered both of them, as they were written as one body of work andi am now finding that i am very interested in the jane and rob "story" as i wasnt on my first run-thru in the 80's. perhaps now after my own "time" of unfolding into these ideas... (tho we all know time is NOT) lol, i have now aquired what feels to me like the perspective that was necessary for me personally to grasp what i could not have fathomed in the 80's... at all. so if your interest DOES include what was "going on" with jane and rob and what it must have taken from them to gestalt THIS body of work in such a cohesive and useable fashion for all those many years, THIS volume adds to that dimension in a way that (to me) none other has.
__label__2 Too Small for Paella!: Sitram is an excellent brand for commercial cookware. However, a 12-inch paella pan is too small for most paella recipes. I use a Calphalon Hard Anodized 16-inch paella pan, and it is always filled to the brim no matter the type of paella that I am making. So, unless one is making dinner for two, I recommend a larger paella pan. Since making paella is a lot of work (and fun, too), I usually make it when entertaining a group. The paella pan can be used for more than paella, such as for making dutch pancakes, latkes, or party-size au gratin dishes. These paella pans do not come with lids, so one might want to buy one separately.
__label__2 Clear explanations with good video close-ups: This video clearly explains the jumps of skating while remaining entertaining. The programs at the end of the video highlight the jumps that were taught from the beginning and gives you a chance to practice identifying the jumps in a competition setting. Great teaching tool!
__label__2 This is one of the best computer games I have played. I would recomend it to anyone.: I love how fast the game got to my house. I would sit here counting the days till it his my doorstep. I had it for only a few minutes and it was already loading onto my computer!!!!
__label__2 Classic book on darkroom work: Excellent book on the basics of film development. Unfortunately, the book was damaged by the US Postal Service (bent it in half to shove it into my mailbox).
__label__1 I think everyone else has said it best....: But, does anyone realize that there are two different Highlander 2 movies out there? This particular one made my skin crawl, for it did not fit with the original. The next one I saw was in my mother's extensive video library and it threw me for a loop. I have no idea where this story came from, but since it is not fresh in my mind, I'll have to watch the latter again.
__label__2 Arnold Lobel - Great Characters........Always!: I didn't think anything could stack up to the Frog and Toad Series, but grasshopper is another great character who encounters more interesting characters on his journey. Wonderfully written, great for ages 4-7.
__label__1 good shipping, shotty product: While the item was well packaged and arrived on time; it does not function completely. The light isn't very bright but is enough for a small stairwell or to light the landing of a basement stairway, but the motion sensor does not trigger the light. After trying multiple trials in varied degrees of light, providing motion at different distances and heights... nada. This light ends up being an expensive, bulky, tap light.Maxxima MLS-01 Occupancy Sensor LED Light
__label__2 Great for mom and dad: Lets face it they need bigger buttons, they are over 80. This phone did the trick. The the the the
__label__1 Short life span, good while it lasted.: I bought my Kodak Easyshare CX7330 in February of 2005. It did well although the older it got, the more it ate batteries. With the money I have spent on batteries I would have been better off getting one with a charger and a pack. I have also tried every type of AA battery out there and it is the camera itself with the issues. Now, 2 and a half years later it has taken it's last pictures. The trouble began with when I would turn it on the indicator light would pop up green, then immediately flash red and the lens would not extend out. Sometimes it would work, sometimes not. Now I can put fresh batteries in and if I hold it just right I can take a few pictures, then the low battery icon comes on the screen and it goes dead, even without retracting the lens. As I said, it was a great little camera while it lasted, but I think I will get something more hardy next time.
__label__2 A Surprisingly Great Story!: I came across this book and was expecting another political yawner .... instead, it was REALLY good. It is written in an easy, engaging style that captures your attention even though you have never heard of any of these people before!! It was interesting to see the inside story especially coming into a presidential election year. I'd love to see a book like this on the national level. How about it Dr. Sidlow?!
__label__1 Anything for money!: It is so sad what people will do for money. Lying, sensationalizing, disrespecting and profitting off another under those reasons is simply wrong. But then again, many people have been doing that to Michael Jackson for years. It's little wonder he hurt. Don't buy this book and allow these kinds of people to treat their fellow man in this way.
__label__2 Get this for your child!: This is clear and easy to use reference book. It includes sentences using the words in context, helping with comprehension.As a child I loved to read and write, so at some point in my life my Mom introduced me to a Thesaurus. To this day it is one of my best friends. Thanks mom.There are adults who do not even know what a thesaurus is!Do your kids a favor and introduce them to a thesaurus!
__label__1 Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of "executive summary" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
__label__2 The Arch of Knowledge: A fantastic history of philosophy with a scientific spin. From Plato and Aristotle, through Galileo, Descartes, Leibniz and Newton to Positivists, Pragmatists and right up to the 80s!Terrific as a popular overview but includes a comprehensive bibliography for more serious readers.
__label__1 The Emperor Has No Clothes: It's to to wake up and smell the vinyl, kids. Bob Pollard's latest aggregate of musicians continues to single handedly destroy the myth of what was once the greatest band in the land. Nowadays Pollard thinks he's writing epic sagas when in reality he's merely recycling old Uriah Heep songs (and doing a poor job at that). The classic Teenage FBI (from the Wish In One Hand EP) sounds as if it was an outtake from HeadEast's Flat As A Pancake. Who was the genuis who thought Ric Ocasek was a smart move? Pollard has lost the magic and it appears as long as Cobre Verde remains involved the magic will never come back. Sorry Bob, but this note ain't for me.
__label__1 Please...Don't waste your time or money....: I rented this movie a few days ago, and it was awful.Horrible acting, ultra low-budget, with a plot that made no sense.I fell asleep, it was so boring.Save your money and your time.
__label__2 Excellent: Really good to read after you've read Chronicles because you just HAVE to know more about Raistlin!
__label__1 'Eh - Plain cholesterol works just as good: Bought this to soften my beard. I had been using a great cholesterol product that was 1lb for $1 but I can no longer find it.I put this product on in the shower after I washed my beard and let it sit for 5-10 mins. It helped some but I expected more. Plus it made my chest break out really bad. I feel there are better Cholesterol products to be found and cheaper.
__label__2 Are you the BASS God?: He must be one of theBass god of 21th century.Like James jemarson,Booty Colins....etcThis dable album have two side.Like the titlle of this Album as you can see.The side of Yin means Shadow,dark...Anyway It featured instmental mainly of course Bass.The other side Yang means Daytime,light....anyway it Futured Songs.Yin have feels more fusion and smooth jazz.Yang is more Funky and straght to feel energys.I like both.It have diffrent flava each other.You can choose the feeling of the day,Party or RElax.It's intersting concept.And for funkeeters! Don't miss it Because Booty Colins is there.He helps Vic.great.So,Victor makes this album made by 16tracks portable recording system.It is hard to beliave easy.This sound is not so bad.You should try it.
__label__2 Great book!: Dawn of a Thousand Nights is extremely well written and kept me wanting to go back to it. I love how Ms Goyer threaded scripture and the message of God's grace throughout the story.
__label__2 dr. Wright understands: wright understands what our medical model doesn't. western medicine has been bought out by the pharmaceutical industry. Thinking "outside the box" Wright explains clearly how to get relief without using these toxic drugs. I was taking Prilosec several times a week with Tums in between. Now I am off all that and feel much healthier.Thank you to Jonathan Wright!
__label__2 Great Collection of Karen Kingsbury Stories: A Kingsbury Collection: Where Yesterday Lives, When Joy Came to Stay, and On Every Side by Karen Kingsbury is 3 Novels in one. I haven't read a lot by Karen Kingsbury but the books I have read do NOT disappoint. Her stories are beautifully written and truly honor God and His love for us. In each of these books show personal struggles of the characters and how God worked in their lives to help overcome these struggles. I found myself taken in from the start of each story and had a hard time putting them down. Each of these stories addresses problems that men and women face on a regular basis: struggles with their belief in God, struggles within marriage, depression, the feeling that life is falling apart. Each story touches on different aspects of life.I highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys Christian Fiction and enjoy Karen Kingsbury's books. You will not be disappointed. I look forward to reading more by Karen Kingsbury.
__label__1 Single Player is fantastic.. but..: Single player is fantastic, but playing Diablo online (multiplayer) is terrible. Cheaters and hackers have ruined online gameplay, the only way to survive is to cheat as well (godmode+more). It's not much of a game after that. Good News though, Diablo II should be cheat/hack free.
__label__2 Great "New" Material: Some of the songs on this CD have been out for a year, but I still enjoy "Do It For Love" and "Heartbreak Time". Of the new songs, I have to say "Forever For You" is their strongest song since "Don't Hold Back Your Love" on Change of Season CD. Also, "Getaway Car" and "Miss DJ" are quite unique tunes that are more main stream music than what are expected from Hall & Oates. There are couple of filler songs, but this CD is a big improvement from Marigold Sky CD. In fact, this is easily their best since Big Bam Boom album. Somehow this CD does not sound like 80's music. Rock'n Soul lives on...
__label__1 Makes a lot of noise, but not much else: I expected more from this toy. It makes a whiring noise, and sounds like the real thing. But it doesn't really blow air. My son was disappointed with it. The goggles are very cheap, and uncomfortable to wear. They left a red ring around my sons eyes.
__label__2 Good to get a party started: This is a compilation of two cd's, one for early in the evening the other for late hours. The material contains mixed 70's Disco tracks from the famous nightclub The Loft in New York. Cd 1 sets of with a funk track called "House Party" slowly building up the entire party. Cd 1 just keep on bulding up the party atmosphere offering groovy harmonic dance tracks. Cd 2 (late)is not so much 70's Disco tracks as the first cd. It offers more deeper House tracks with a dash of groovy sexy vibes in them hopefully making the female guest at the party to let themselves a bit more loose on the dancefloor and in their conversations with the male guests. I recommend this one because it is nice to have something that almost everyone like in your House collection.
__label__2 mahjong: I love buying at amazon for the products they sell and come on time, great job I myself says. Now this game is fun if your a mahjong player like I am so everyone you'll like it like I have and beat it too.
__label__1 WCF12 and the ipaq h2215: I'm going on 4 months now and still this card does not work with my ipaq. I'm running WIN CE4.20 on the ipaq, I've tried installing the drivers every-which-way I can think of to no avail. Linksys support did not help, they are just as baffled as to why. I'm running a 3-system wireless network using Linksys everything works great, just can't get this card to work. I've been reading all kinds of reviews from all kinds of web-sites for this card, and have come to the conclusion that it does not work. I'm going to use bluetooth instead, hope that works.
__label__2 Classic movie: Havent seen this movie since i was a kid it ws just as i remembered it I love the fact that you can find almost any movie through this site
__label__2 Great book on codependency: This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and i enjoyed reading it. I did not like the structure of the book so much, but the author provides really good material on Codependency and how to recover from it. The book does not flow very well from one chapter to another, but on the bright side, you can pretty much pick it up at any chapter and read it without feeling lost. Overall, I would recommend this book to people who struggle with codependency issues and especially issues of romance or relationship addiction.
__label__1 I too had the lock break after about 13 months......: I loved this gate, but the lock mechanism broke in the lock position and there is no way to fix it. I am very disappointed and now have a pressure gate at the top of the stairs until I can find a replacement. Don't buy!Update: Since I had the hardware installed in the casing already I purchased another one of these...and another....and another. so far I'm on my fourth gate and each one has failed at almost exactly 13 months. Always the lock mechanism. It's too bad that they don't have a replacement lock mechanism for this gate. The good news is that I only have to replace the one part of the gate that contains the lock mechanism. Bad news is that I've had to throw away all of the rest of the new parts that come with it. Very environmentally unfriendly. If you haven't bought one...don't!!!!
__label__1 Bad Experience: I should have read other's reviews before I purchased this. The directions made no sense and didn't explain anything. After charging headphones for a very long time, they wouldn't come on or do anything. Luckily, Amazon.com is a great company and I was able to return the junk. I hope they discontinue to offer this item on their site.
__label__1 Too Bad: Fred Solinger wrote : in many ways, "one more time" is what one would imagine the never-recorded stardust album would sound like.Fred I think it's a big mistake.Vik wrote : Don't buy this pop.Vik you are 200 % right.I mean I was expecting from Daft Punk very strong and cool album, instead of that I recieved something like electronic Cher. Funny, but when my girlfriend went trough the door I was listening to "one more time" and she asked me : look, what's wrong with you, are you listnening to Cher or what?The only thing I can say is that I am too disapointed, coz this album is too comercial and it sounds too pop, if you like quality sound of electronic music, don't purchase this CD.
__label__2 Check Six! exudes excitement!: Check Six! made me laugh and cry and kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. It also gave me a better understanding of how an aircraft carrier works and how the different personnel work together to accomplish the mission. There was plenty of high powered flying and shipboard intrigue.
__label__2 Nice watch: Well I bought this watch for my brother's birthday. He still hasn't taken it off. He loves it! the only problem I had with it was it was a little light. I like a nice heavy watch. but over all it's a very nice watch
__label__1 5 stars for Morrie, 0 for Mitch; so averages at 2.5 stars: This book would have been so much better if it was an autobiography! I loved Morrie, but I found Mitch very annoying. He is a workaholic, and I am not, so I had absolutely nothing in common with him. But give me Morrie's wisdom anyday! He tells a great proverb about waves and the ocean that I will never forget. My only guess as to why everyone loves this entire book is that they also fell in love with Morrie; I just hope they were not equally enamored of Mitch. Shallow city. But at least it is a short book so I didn't have to endure him for very long. I am glad I read it, but this book did not live up to all of the hype. I approach any book that is touted as a must read by so many people as one that reaches the lowest common denominator in our society, and that is not a good thing. Read it because Morrie is a gem, not because everyone is telling you to read it.
__label__1 A Very BIG Disappointment: This is the lamest book I've seen in ages. I mean, the storyline is much too boring. I'm a big fan of Sweet Valley Jr. High, and decided to try out this brand-new series. I have to say that I was definitely disappointed. I seriously do not recommend this book. I read the first one, and found that at least a teensy weensy bit better. But I have to say, I want SVU BACK!!!!!
__label__1 The Don't Work!!: Bought three "large" size from a local store. We were told they had been "redesigned"...I think with a "fill to here" line to prevent pressure on the sealed edge.Two lost their vacuum and filled with air within 15 minutes and we returned the lot.This is a great concept but there is clearly something wrong with the design - possibly the "zip-lock" type seal or possibly the valve.In any event, we do not recommend the Space Bag and give it only one star because it does not work as advertised.
__label__1 Pure Love: I struggle hard to find a good story to read. Too many are filled with vulgarity, immorality - graphically described, and too much violence. This one caught me off guard. It has compassion. It has a very deep morality. It reminded me so much of what I have ahead of me in building the hearts of my children.Recommend it? You bet!Not just for those who love romance, but for those who have teens to guide and really enjoy good literature.
__label__2 Thinking about Pilates?? Try this DVD!!!!: I was really nervous about trying pilates from a DVD at home without taking a class first, but I really liked it and thought this DVD was of excellent quality! Also, I was a dancer for 18 years and after doing this DVD for the first time, I realized I had no idea how much of my training was from pilates. So, for anyone out there who is taking dance classes (mostly ballet or floor barre)or was a dancer at some point..., you will find some of the exercises you do very familar :-) Just think, you will be doing exercises professional dancers do!!Still, the instructor is helpful, but not annoying like some tapes. Besides having a great beginner section, this DVD has a intermediate section, as well, which is great! This DVD is a good investment, especially if you can't make it to the gym, or your gym doesn't offer pilates.
__label__1 YUCKY! Not worth my weight watchers points!: I bought these with the hopes I could eat them at the movie theater and save myself the extra calories. I started Weight Watchers 3 months ago and you can have 7 vines for 2 points which is really good. I tasted these as soon as I got them in the mail, YUCK! They are super hard to chew, it took me 20 minutes to chew 1 bite and I thought I was going to rip a tooth out. They have a horrible waxy weird aftertaste that is really bad. My husband likes to chew on them for hours (because 1 will take you an hour to chew!) but he hates the taste. I would spend your money on something other than this.
__label__2 Great book, great movie: I actually saw the movie first and was blown away by it. Then I read the book, and "knowing" what was coming was even more devestated! What a powerful, jaw-dropping experience it was for me to read this. I'm reminded of other books dealing with child abuse ("A Child Called It" or McCrae's "Bark of the Dogwood"--though the latter is actually funny at times, if you can believe that). But Sybil remains top of the list with regards to horror stories. The pacing of the book is just incredible, and the build up to the "climax" is truly well-crafted. Highly recommended, but not for the faint-of-heart!
__label__2 The "Truest" form of New Age Solo Piano Music, IMHO.: The first time I heard this CD(LP at that time), I wasn't captured by it. I mainly played it as background music. Then suddenly, one day, it just hit me that Mr Aaberg's compositions are truely works of art. I've played this CD a thousand times already & I never get tired of listening to it. In fact, I continuously try to mimic it on my piano. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't gifted with 14" fingers which Mr Aaberg seems to have(I bought his Piano transcriptions book, & I don't know how one could've played "Mariah's River Breakdown" with normal length fingers.) There's just one wish though, I wish they'd release this CD remastered to sound as close as possible to a Steinway piano & in HDCD format. I highly recommend this CD!!!
__label__2 The Year of Magical Thinking: A well-written book and a good sharing of personal emotions. Sometimes seemed like name-dropping at it's best (or worst) but I suppose if you know all the best people you mention them and their effect on your life.
__label__2 Good quick book.: I heard about this book from work of mouth from another med student who is currently doing AIDS research in East Africa. As a soon-to-be medical student and someone who has traveled to some of the places mentioned, I found this book interesting and affirming. He includes some of his opinions about Africa and the nature of his work that made it personal. One small point that I found especially interesting was that he (a plastic surgeon) seems to place reconstructive and "cosmetic" surgery (such as elective breast augmentation on a man or breast reduction on a woman with unequally sized breasts) on a somewhat equal plane - as one might expect a plastic surgeon to do. While I don't really agree, his argument was thought-provoking. I highly recommend this book.
__label__1 Save Your Money, Folks: This is flat out the worst piece of shit I have ever seen in a so-called documentary of either The Beatles or anyone else for that matter. Spotty, inaccurate and so full of the filmmaker's lame-brained and asinine opinions that it will make you want to throw things. Cobbled together with footage from God knows where, this poor excuse for a film is an agonizing exercise in plain stupidity. It's not even remotely entertaining. If you absolutely must see this, borrow it from a library and watch it first before you buy. The box says 'Collector's Edition DVD' but they really mean 'Completist.' Save your money and stick to the Anthology. Sorry Amazon, for blowing a potential sale but product like this is best reserved for landfills.
__label__2 Great Service: The product arrived so quickly. Unfortunately, the product had a small defect and when I called the company, they sent another item right away. I received the replacement so quickly as well. In fact, I got both items in the time that they said I would have received the first. Great customer service and great product. Thank you! It will be a fun gift for my end of year celebration with my students. We use FROG to mean For Recognition of Greatness :)
__label__1 The Book of the Trite: This book is awful! It's 'Silence of the Lambs' meets 'Dark Shadows' meets Ann Rice's witches' series - with none of the originality of any of them. The characters are ridiculous stereotypes from soap operas and cop shows. Their names are hard enough to swallow, but their actions stretch the suspension of disbelief. Come one, "Aloysius and Diogenes Pendergast!" An FBI agent who lives in mansion, complete with a dungeon? Ancestors who lived on the brink of madness and genius? It's just really an awful, awful book.
__label__1 FULL-PRICE???!!!! YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!: One of the most complicated movies ever made, and there isn't one making-of doc, outtake, deleted scene, trailer, or commentary included on this release? Even the $5.99 Scooby-Doo DVD's my kid watches have something extra. Maybe if this release was priced the same as those, I'd buy it. MAYBE.
__label__1 Cheap Made & Horrible Fit: I typically wear a large in T-shirts but the large in this one is WAY to big for me. The sleeve openings are big enough to wear around my legs. I returned it for a medium and the medium is too small but the sleeves are still huge. It just looks weird and doesn't feel soft and breathable like the 50/50 shirts I'm used to wearing.
__label__1 way too fast....not what I would consider yoga: I bought this based on a friend's recommendation...but I wouldn't call it yoga. He moves way too quickly...no time to get into poses for advanced people, and no learning of poses for beginners.
__label__1 A World of Butterflies: Nice book, however the majority of photos are of specimens rather than living butterflies in a natural setting.Text is well thought out. Nice coffee table book.
__label__2 Quality knob and durable finish.: It's a locking door knob. It looks nice but more importantly it was an exact match for the ones the builder installed in my new home. I only had to replace it because I locked myself out of the house and had to drill through it. I would happily buy it again but when I took it to the store to be re-keyed I purchased a few spares so (I hope) this won't happen again.
__label__1 Shocked!: Except for the name Caran d'Ache, this hardly qualifies as a fine writing instrument and is more in the category of pens of BIC quality. In fact, it is simply a cheaply made plastic pen that happens to have been produced in Switzerland. To complete the outrage, it arrived in a tawdry vinyl coin purse-like case that was an insult. For $70.00 plus shipping, one expects to be rather pleased with the purchase when it is a Caran d'Ache. But this, this is beyond comprehension. I have used pens chained to the counters at banks that were more impressive. At least those pens are more substantial and more smoothly finished. Caran d'Ache should be ashamed of this crummy piece of trash! No self respecting collector of fine writing instruments would display this. The humiliation would be just too much to bear.
__label__1 Confusing book: I was reading this book for reference on ChangeListener (page 729). The examples given does not even IMPLEMENT the ChangeListener interface. What a strange way to programing. This is entirely different from LeMay's TY 21 day examples. I am really confused. I am not buying another book by the same authors.
__label__1 This camera is a dud!: The QuickCam VC (parallel port version) has been nothing but trouble since I purchased it. It was impossible to install. It never functioned properly. I was never able to get it to work. Customer support is only from 9-5 M-F (and long distance), so it was of no help to me. Once I got throught with customer support they were unable to fix the problem.This is the last device I buy from logitech!
__label__1 Disappointing rebrand of another DVD: I received this two disc set as a Christmas gift and just got a chance to watch it. Unfortunately disc one seemed overly familiar to me. This is because it is also sold as "Ultimate Nascar DVD Collection - Nascar Thrills". Disc two may be a "repeat too, but I'm not familiar with it. I wish companies would stop reissuing product under different names. It is dishonest and disaapointing.
__label__1 Abdo is "absolutly doo-doo": This thing is a piece of junk and honestly these people should be ashamed of themselves, even the exercise dvd that comes with the machine makes it look like a good workout, except that the equipment doesnt flow smoothly like it does on the infomercial or in the dvd, its stiff and uncomfortable and the "mesasger" hurts. I dont think I will ever watch late night informercials again, I have learned an expensive lesson.
__label__2 A good Oldtime Movie: It was a good movie..but a few things were overlooked ie: snow on the mufflers of the Norton after Marriane Faithfull had just ridden it up the mountain, and the speed she was riding on snow and ice... but on the whole a good clean bike movie and worth viewing again and again!
__label__1 i did not buy it: I cancelled my order for this product, therefore, I do not have anything to review.
__label__2 My kids won't stop asking for it!: I got this album at the local library, and we have now been checking it out for about 6 months in a row. Now I've decided to take the plunge and actually buy the thing. It rocks! It is friendly, parent-friendly and not cheesy so you can't stand it, like most kids' albums. We all sing along to every song, and I admire the way it has some old American songs lovingly rendered, from the era when people used to sit around and sing to each other without television. This is a guy from Camper Van Beethoven, if any of you remember that interesting and eclectically smart band. So tell your friends! The guy from Camper Van Beethoven is writing kids' music now! And it's cool!
__label__2 Great Story: I've always loved "fast", so naturally I love fighter jets. Hearing and seeing the story from this view was really cool. I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys seeing how humans accomplish truly great things.
__label__2 Solution to the CF memory corruption problem: It could be that resetting the camera to its default state (by holding down the "menu" button for an few seconds) initiates a soft reboot of the camera that is as effective as the hard reboot resulting from removal of the internal battery (and it's a lot easier). Any failures with either method?Note added: for a real fix the camera needs to be repaired by Canon. I gave up and sent mine in. Insist they not charge; similar models with the same problem have been recalled.
__label__2 Great movie: Great movie about the way Vietnam changed the lives of those involved in it. De Niro is great as the strong,deep, leader of his group of friends.
__label__1 Poor quality, sorry to say.: A good electric kettle is a kitchen essential. The Breville is landfill-bound sooner rather than later. This made-in-China kettle doesn't reliably shut off once the water's reached a boil. It'll just boil and boil and boil and boil and boil until YOU shut it off. Indicator light? Nice flashing lightning-storm effect during the six months it lasted (it flashed beautifully for no reason). Now there's no indicator light at all. Is it on? Is it off? Who can tell? This kettle is slow to heat. Slower than a microwave, slower than my range. Disappointing right out of the box.
__label__1 Didn't last: I bought a couple of these cap leash before (not sure which brand) and they lasted. This one however didn't last. The double sided tape didn't hold and my cap fell off.
__label__2 CLEOPATRA - A WONDERFUL SOUNDTRACK: Cleopatra which has the music by that fine composer of Film and Televison score's Trevor Jones begins with "Cleopatra" which instantly takes you to Alexandria. The next track is the more laid back "Egypt Is Yours For Only One Day" as each wonderful track unfolds we continue the journey of 'Cleopatra's' life, as you listen to this stirring Soundtrack you feel as if you are in Egypt with it's conflicts and battles at the time, plus all the romance as Cleopatra captures the heart of the two most powerful men in the world. This again is an outstanding Soundtrack by Trevor Jones and I just cannot stop playing it. If you are into Soundtracks I recommend that you add 'Cleopatra' to your collection as I am sure you will not be disappointed.
__label__1 Dont waste your money!!: After trying (and failing) to stay awake whilst reading the novel, I can recommend it as a sure-fire cure for insomnia! Aside from that the book is boring, badly written and a real disapointment.
__label__2 This is a love song........ :))): I really love it... And true, if you're truly deeply madly in love with someone, it's a great song to listen to. Believe me...
__label__2 Featuring ordinary village people and daily life: Enhanced with a brief but informative introduction by Karen Sinsheimer and Roberto Tejada's insightful essay, Joan Almond: The Past In The Present showcases an amazing and impressive photographic journey by documentary photographer Joan Almond through the Islamic desert communities of North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East in a outstanding anthology of images featuring ordinary village people and daily life in a profound black-and-white photography that fully captures the spirit of a land and its people. Brief thoughts and a short essay or two are interspersed between the lengthy sections of captivating photographs. An extraordinary look at the human culture and the daily quest to survive and prosper, Joan Almond: The Past In The Present is a very highly recommended and enduring contribution to personal, professional, and academic collections.
__label__2 Philips 5-Device Remote With Learning And Advanced DVD Functions (PM520G: Works perfectly and all functions of the tv were accessable. The remote was deliverd much faster than expected. Packaging was perfect, no wasred space.
__label__1 Vade Retro: I've purchased this CD hoping to find the original songs. I couldn't be more calamitously wrong. I suggest to keep yourself away from it.CD incautamente acquistato nell'illusione di trovarvi i pezzi originali, spero di risparmiarvi una cocente delusione. Da evitare con ogni cura.
__label__2 Good, Not Great: This bench is decent enough for the price. Assembly wasn't too difficult. However, the maximum weight capacity according to the manual is 300 pounds so I hope you aren't a 200 pound guy planning on benching more than 100 pounds...
__label__1 I think this is a disinformation hoax: This book is an unbelievable account of life adventures of the author, who claims to be very special alien creation for the purpose of using his special structures (DNA, etc.) to create other life in the universe. And you have to understand, that he is so much more evolved that the rest of us.The author maybe a confused human being (programmed and controlled by very bad people). He may be sincere, but I don't think that he is a free person. This kind of fictions are usually used to discredit legitimate programmed individuals who break free from controlled hold, and those who help them. Besides the book is set heavy in occult, and have agenda to discredit GOD and His Word the Bible.It stinks.
__label__1 CRAP!: This didn't pop out at you or scare you at out like a normal "pop out snake toy" is supposed to. It was slow and just plan stupid. Don't order this crap. Totally worthless.
__label__1 It's all so dull: How many alterna-clones like this can you get? It's just the latest in the string of guitar bands with an offbeat vocalist who puts strange inflection on his voice because he can't REALLY sing. Plus, it is overplayed on the radio, especially 'Push' which is one of the most irritating alternative songs ever (the lyrics are moronic). I'm actually not sure why I gave it two stars. I guess they deserve credit for not being rap music. Not reccomended at all.
__label__1 I never touch this cd and I get no requests for it.: I'm a Dj so I am always buying new music. I bought this cd because occasionally I buy cd's that I am not familiar with in the hope that I will find some gems out there that I wasn't previously familiar with. This cd was not the case. I never touch it and I never get any requests for it. Most of the music sounds like cumbias made with a synthesizer...I do not like the sound at all. I'll stick to Selena, Kumbia Kings, and other tejano music. I don't recommend it.
__label__2 A Must Own!: This is one of my favorites--of any genre. I accidentally found it by following a link on Napster Radio, and I've been listening to it almost every day since.The guest appearance by Paul Simon is little more than a curiosity, in this case, but certainly not a distraction. The styles are wide and varied, from Salsa to Mambo to Jazz. The production values are the only thing that lets you know that this album was released in 2007, as the music defies a "time" of style.I would recommend this album to any fan of Latin music, whether you are a beginner or have spent many years listening to the genre.
__label__1 Vocal Gems from OKLAHOMA!: The 1947 London cast of OKLAHOMA! recorded only highlights from the score arranged in 3-song medleys and spread over 4 78 RPM sides. You get sense of the story (wth the songs all out of order) and the performances - even the great Howard Keel - do not come across well due to the age of the masters. A curio for collectors who want every version of the score and possibly for Keel fans. Otherwise stick with the more complete albums. (WARNING: Total playing time for these OKLAHOMA! selections is about 16 minutes. Even with the bonus tracks this is a very short CD!)
__label__2 Timeless classic: I love this album when I was in High school (in the 1970s and the album is still great. Harmonies, melodies, lyrics, all make for a great , creative effort. Just a great album. Of course not quite the same, but I look forward to seeing them in November on Long Island.
__label__2 Lovely: Dan Gibson music is all wonderful but I think his Celtic music is especially nice. Good music for reading by.
__label__1 2 different helmets fell apart within first week of receiving: I purchased this helmet based on reviews and when I received it, I was very happy - It looked great and fit great too. Then, within the first week, the plastic shell began warping in several places from sunlight/summer heat and separated from the Styrofoam helmet body. I live by the beach in Los Angeles.I returned the defective helmet to Amazon for a replacement and within a week of receiving the replacement, it also warped and separated from the helmet body, leaving me with the equivalent of a toddler's Styrofoam starter helmet. I am very disappointed with the quality of this helmet and would not recommend for anyone who lives where it is hot and sunny.
__label__2 Very nice: Much better than expected....very nice contemporary art for reasonable cost. With nice frames it looks elegant. It sure is awesome.
__label__2 Some Excellent Tracks: This album has two of Chris Rea's best tracks, in my opinion. The rocky, slightly sleazy, 'Let It Loose On Me', and the the weird 'Love's Strange Ways'. The rest are standard Chris Rea - melodic, reflective, and atmospheric, and none the worse for that.
__label__2 Great read: A great insight to the man and the history of the club...all in all a great read! Couldn't put it down.
__label__1 Could only watch it once!!: Like the other reviewers, I couldn't agree more. I went to the concert when he came down here to New Zealand, and the concert still stands as one of the best concerts I have ever been to, and believe me, I have been to a lot!!So I was very keen to have a record of this great concert but this was total [hogwash]. Not the show!! The visual presentation of the show. I can't even watch it, its done so badly. Here's a tip Mr Director, just point the camera towards the stage area - and walk away!! Believe me it would have been better if he did.See if you can rent it first before you buy it.
__label__1 Disaster Movie (Unrated Widescreen): don't remember watching a comedy film that doesn't have a single funny moment within the entire film. Coupled with no plot, no character development, poor acting and a barrage of Rom-Com clichés you end up with one of the worst films in recent years... And it was still a number 1 box office smash.... God help us all
__label__2 Written in the 1950's, still a relevant, timely book: In the search for resources dealing with the great flood of scripture, I've found this book to be an excellent resource. Although written in the 50's, the content is still surprisingly up to date, well reasoned, well presented, and well documented. Mr. Rehwinkle deals with pre and post flood material as well. Concordia Publishing House is still publishing this book in paperback almost half a century later for good reason. If you're interested in the topics of the deluge, pre or antediluvian man, or just want to read a book that provides overwhelming evidence of a worldwide flood, this belongs on your bookshelf.
__label__1 The Worst Toy Idea Ever!: When I first came across this offering I thought it was a joke. What kind of person would promote this product--certainly not a parent trying to raise a responsible and thoughtful child.I have an idea--how about a drunk tank to put li'l Homer in after his DUI conviction, or maybe an emergency room for when he blacks out and crashes his car!
__label__1 Boring: If you like doing the same moves over and over then this is the DVD for you. I got bored and only did the workout a couple of times.
__label__2 Spellbinding!!: This is easily the finest collection of psychedelic music ever put together and perhaps the best box set ever. Culled from the original Nuggets released in 1972, this collection has been greatly expanded. It is short on hits and long on obscure garage bands whose music might have been lost forever if it hadn't been for this set. Every kid wanted to play guitar and be a rock star at that time. It gives us an incredible insight into this era and the music that helped shape it. As usual the sound is first rate as we have come to expect from Rhino who continues to do all it can to preserve our musical heritage on it's label. This is truly a landmark collection.
__label__2 best friends and bad marriages: Two couples, best friends, explore the problems and possibilities of marriage and go their separate ways. Which couple chose the better path?
__label__1 Where's the ice cream?: This Cuisinart ice cream maker sounded too good to be true. Unfortunately, even though I followed the directions precisely, what I got was not ice cream...not even close. It never thickened. It tasted good (we drank it), but it was not what I wanted. I would like to know if I did something wrong, but as I said, I followed directions.
__label__2 Exactly what it looks like: This is precisely what it is advertised to be - a short list of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, one per page. For those of us that regularly surf memory-alpha.org, you may notice a few of the official rules are missing, and quite a few taken from the apocrypha (namely, the rules that Ira Steven Behr created).
__label__2 one word...AMAZING: i'll never forget when i was younger(i'm almost 21 now)my dad had this record in his collection and listened to it alot.i remeber it always sitting out and i remeber that i was so scared of gene's face on the cover with the blood on it i wanted my dad to get rid of it right then and there(i was about 2 or 3)by the time i hit age 12-13 i was totally getting into them and i asked my dad why he got rid of it(he said he did years earlier,but guess what..he never did)i'll never forget the first time i listened to it...i was blown away.i quickly went out and bought all their albums(i still need to get some on cd even though i have them all on lp and cassette)sadly i still have yet to see kiss live in person(i was out of town each time they came around to my area)but this album lets me get a listen to the classic sound of kiss and how it was then and how it is now.-jason
__label__2 Its About Time: What's up fans? Just a quick note to tell you about this Screwed and Chopped release, well for one its done pretty good, lots of bring backs and good chopping, well worth the money...
__label__2 Highlander from the past: Was great! Didn't think I would like it till I really got to reading it. Kind of long and slow in parts but you will keep reading it just to see how it ends. Got all her books after reading this one.
__label__2 Herbal Essence Review: Surprisingly in Salisbury this town of 30,000 in NC the local Walmart, Eckerds, CVS, and Walgreens no longer carry this product as they stock only their similar namebrand. The local JC Penny and Belks department store cosmetics dept also do not carry this item. Amazon purchase was less time consuming then trying to buy and save a few bucks on Ebay. I was pleased with the promptness of shipment and the price seemed reasonable. The product itself has been used a long time by my elderly mother and was bought as a birtday present.
__label__1 Rechargeable batteries overheat: I used these batteries once, and now they will not charge properly. I use a Kodak NiMH charger that shuts down when done. The charger operates well using other NiMH cells. These Energizer batteries kept charging overnight and would not stop. The batteries got very warm. I believe that they are shorted.
__label__2 I love SHAWNA MASSEY: Shawna was 18 only two weeks prior to being picked up as a hitchhiker by Arny Freytag and his assistant Dennis Silverstein. She was promised that they would take her anywhere she wanted to go, if only she wanted to go to see the auditions for Women of Aspen pictorial. When she arrived to the home where some of her friends from school, and their mothers, were holding their portfolios...she was given the task of handing out the paperwork to those who were auditioning. After everyone left, she was told that it was her turn to audition, so she phoned her dad to ask permission. The following weekend her photo appeared on the cover of the Aspen Times with Freytag, Silverstein and Tomlinson with an inside story of her fathers business there in ASPEN.
__label__2 Amazing: Amazing book one of my favorites I actually felt like I was apart of the story it is the best book I have ever read
__label__2 Great book: I am currently reading this book and it is so easy to read and easy to comprehend. You learn everything from the beginning of psychology history and so. I completely recommend this book.
__label__2 Another Son Volt masterpiece: I grew up listening to country and got away from it as I got older. This band has brought me back to it in a huge way and introduced me to a bunch of other bands that I never knew existed 3 years ago. While Trace is still my favorite, and Straightaways was good, in spite of some less than enthusiastic reviews, this album reminds me of UT's Anodyne album. Jay Farrar is one of the best songwriters out there, in any musical genre. I saw them live for the first time in Somerville, MA about a week before the album came out. It was supposed to be an all acoustic show, but they were all plugged in during the second half of the show and they kicked ass! The thing that amazes me is that more people haven't heard of 'em around here. Do yourself a favor - Buy this CD!
__label__2 Great Book: One of the best books I have read on the subject of handling money. Gives a thorough scriptual basis for the writers reasoning.I would highly recommend this for both young and old Christians.Makes you think of what your real purpose in life should be in the world.
__label__1 Very poor ball head construction - no tension: Purchsed 5 of these for an installation, only to find that the swivel ball heads wouldn't hold no matter how tight you make it. The cameras started to droop within minutes and couldn't get the tension to go back again after that. It was a one shot deal, as soon as they slipped they were no good after that. Very poor quality construction. Comes with lots of extensions and accessories though, so it seemed good from the picture.
__label__1 You call this Tai Chi???: I would give this one 0 star if Amazon allowed me.I read all the good reviews on this DVD and decided to get a copy. Luckly we had one from the local library.After I reviewed the library copy, I am completely shocked that someone can produce a DVD like this one and call it "Tai Chi". It is not even half way close.The demonstrator didn't even get his movement right. In fact the content of the DVD is a set of morning exercise combining a little bit of everything possibly Asian: primary school morning exercise, some basic Yoga breathing and postures, some partial Tai Chi gesture. Coming from an Asian background, I almost felt this is an insult.If you are serious about learning Tai Chi, don't get misled by this DVD.
__label__2 Great Mop: I think this is an excellent mop. It is thick and absorbant. I had no problems with it whatsoever and found that it lasted a long time. Sure, a few threads come off from time-to-time, but much less than other mopheads I have purchased.
__label__2 WOW!!!: Wow! Rock Kills Kid's freshman album is a breath of fresh air. The first song, "Paralized" is a classic pop rock anthem. A hint of "U2" seems spread throughout the tracks along with simple, yet breathe-taking music. I picked this CD from the recommendation of a music store employee and I was not let down.
__label__1 Stay Away!: My experience with this device was horrible. It took weeks to get it to work right, I spent hours on the phone with tech support who couldn't figure out why. Finally the "master tech" spoke to "the designers" and they sent me some software update which made it work. However this was after 2 replacements that all failed to work (Windows XP)Even once it workd it turned out that the software is incompatible with Vista.And when I had to wipe my XP computer and wanted to reinstall it, I found that all software download link were removed from smarthome's web site, leaving me with a useless wall wart.BUYER BEWARE: STAY AWAY!
__label__2 Better than more expensive brands: This 2-blade razor gives a much closer shave than a more expensive brand that has more blades. The Bic Twin Select gets good mileage, and the colors are pleasant. Definitely buying more.
__label__1 Wow, what a glob of lies and hate: This book is an embarrassment to literate people, and people who are illiterate are lucky that they don't have the opportunity to read this piece of trash.Sean Hannity must be either the most ignorant person on the planet, or the biggest liar on the planet. Who did the editing for this piece of garbage? The words "fact checking" never applied to the editors of this gem. There are enough skewed facts, misquotes, and flat out lies in this book to last a typical politician a lifetime.The name of this book should have been "Let Freedom Wrong, Winning the War over Liberalism by Way of Lies and Slander". I truly feel sorry for people that believe the hate speech spewed by morons such as Sean Hannity.
__label__1 This film does not live up to its hype!: Romeo Must Die is a mildly entertaining film that just doesn't live up to its potential. Many of the reviews I have read compare it favorably to The Matrix, but this is ridiculous. Now, don't get me wrong...Jet Li is a phenomenal martial artist. Martial arts alone, however, do not make a great film. The acting was poor and the improbable fight sequences were downright silly, as they were physically impossible (at least in The Matrix, there is a logic that allows for gravity-defying flips, etc). Finally, the relationship between Han and Trish simply doesn't go far enough to warrant a "Romeo & Juliet" romantic link. They never even kiss for crying out loud! Overall, not a good film.
__label__1 it's a text book for a class, big whoop!: the world trade created is a required reading text book for an AP class at high school. I'm reading it because the teacher, who is a liberal, is requiring me to read it. Am I excited? well no! I'd rather read something a little more ...exciting.
__label__1 Poor compat, worse support: Bought this for my son at Costco. Tried installing it on 3 different PCs, each of which exceeded the minimum recommended settings by far.In all three, the program installed without a hitch and would not run.I then tried contacting tech support and relaying the detailed diagnostic log information. They were less than helpful and suggested "fixes" that broke compatability with other programs - and still did not work. I will be returning this software this week and purchasing Fritz and Chesster.
