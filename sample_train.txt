__label__2 Hard to find recharger: I was simply not able to find the big charger in the stores...they seemed to have only the small chargers that charge only 4 AA,AAA batteries at a time and won't charge C's or D's. This will charge 8 AA,AAA's or 4 C's or D's. I have one of these chargers and bought one for my son and grandson. Invaluable in preparing for snowstorms here in New England!
__label__1 BEWARE!!!!!: I loved the machine - until it broke. THERE'S NO FRIGGIN' TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR REPAIR OPTIONS from Schwinn. They don't care.
__label__1 Apple computers?: I hate to break it to you as well but apple had nothing to do with this design. Another thing is the fact that apple isnt known for their style and design they are known for the ipod and making the worst posseble computers on the market.I have a few things with this phoneproseasy to navigatelooks coollots of extrasConsbreaks easyeveryone in the united states has one just like itthe buttons/keypad is bad for textingto tell you the truth it gets old to look at because your friend neighbor uncle brother inlaws that guy walking to work and that guy screaming at you has one
__label__1 Panasonic junk: Purchased a Panasonic KX-FL501 from Amazon.com on August 01, 2001 and replaced it 06/13/02 with a Brother IntelliFAX 2800, which so far has been an infinitely more satisfactory machine for exactly the same price. The KX-FL501 was complex to set up, program, and use beyond absolutely basic functions, copy quality was barely adequate for a machine in its price range and it gave constant problems with multiple page FAXes; both sending and receiving. Sending, it would feed several pages of the original at once. Receiving, it would pull several blank pages from the paper tray, often so many it would jam. Adjustments did next to no good. Essentially, it was non-functional.
__label__1 Less expensive models that do a better job: This did not live up to the boasting of prior reviews. It arrived damaged, cosmetically, but when tested with household odors did not work as expected.
__label__1 I loved this camera: ...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started. Nonetheless, I loved this camera, and I think it was worth it, even though it only worked a year. Now I've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera.
__label__1 Unfair, false and trashy story!: With the artificial, fake story and political help of William Hoffer Betty made a chunk of money and her selfishness deprived a father from his doughter...very silly and absurd book. Doesn't worth a penny.
__label__1 Dead time stories: This movie was very disappointing.First of all I bought it brand new from Amazon.comand it was only a dvd-r disc(cheaper form of DVD).Secondly the print quality was very bad.I got strange new world(1987 VHS)from Amazon.co.uk and the print quality of that was better than dead time stories.In the end I couldn't watch it and had to throw away the disc.I have bought 150 aprox movies from Amazon.com and am very satisfiedhowver Dead time stories is not one of them.
__label__1 Just Bad Music: I own the CD, in my opinion this is just bad music writing. Save some money. do something you may enjoy better. (like getting a tooth pulled)
__label__2 What are you guys talking about?: This movie is great. MUCH better than the original. The storyline is enchanting, Nicole Kidman is great, and the wit is delicious!!
__label__2 A Book Review of Holes: I think Holes was a really good book. I couldn't put it down until I had finished it.The setting of the story is Camp Green Lake. The main characters are Stanley, X-ray, Zero, Mr. Sir, and the Warden. Stanley is the major character in the book. Zero and X-ray are the nicknames of two of his friends at Camp Green Lake. Mr. Sir and the Warden are in charge of Camp Green Lake. One of the main events in the story is when a famous sports player's shoes land on Stanley's head. He is arrested for stealing them and has to dig holes at Camp Green Lake. I'm not going to tell you the ending, but this was a great book.
__label__2 Nicely done errorica: This was a good readwell writen with good character development. The plot is OK but a little silley as I don't see someone using rustling as a cover for drug smugling. Overall notably better than average for the genra.
__label__1 Is it over yet?: This movie is just like most other Bond movies except with 30 minutes of story, interaction, and humour edited out. Lots of fancy camera work thou is suppossed to make up for it. There is a skeletal plot based on the events of Casino Royale, but I could hardly understand much or try to care what Bond's motivations are... all you know is that he is pissed for some good reason and he doesn't care about anything except that he is pissed. Craig is given one expression to show, and he looks good showing it. And the movie ends as another Bond movie. Kinda boring and uninvolving, but it looks good I suppose.
__label__2 TENSE & EXCITING! MORE OF A 4 1/2 STARRER!: When I came across the book in a garage sale, I just bought it coz DeMille's name was familiar. I'm glad I did! Of course, the ending was predictable..had to be a happy ender. But what keeps you at the edge of your seat is how the survivors managed throughout the flight & how they DID it!
__label__2 Great Software - Very Comprehensive: I borrowed the CD from a friend and now I'm gonna buy it for myself. It is really user-friendly and I would recommend it to anyone!
__label__1 Even Deborah Foreman Can't Save This Movie: After watching Deborah Foreman in Valley Girl and Real Genius, I figured a cheesy movie could be made worthwhile with a beautiful face. I was wrong. The screenplay is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, and the acting... well let's say this movie should not even be played on cable at 3AM!
__label__2 Great game that ends too early!: I bought this game on a whim...I used to hate first-person shooters. However, NOLF 2 gives me hope that the FPS is moving a fun, new, and involved direction. NOLF 2 is not your typical shoot everything that moves bloodfest. The spy-spoof premise draws the player in and keeps the gameplay exciting through and through.The graphics are pretty fantastic, sound is great (you can hear the enemies coming from behind you), and controls are easy to use.The ONLY downside to this game is it ends rather suddenly and unsuspectedly. I probably spent around 15 hours to complete the game. However, the fact that this game is so fantastic and the hope of a three-quel totally redeems the ending.Pick this game up! You won't regret it!
__label__2 Make your business dreams come true!: This book is jam packed with ideas and exercises that will help you literally kick start your business. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking about starting a business or enhancing their current business. My eyes have been opened to recognizing all kinds of opportunities for my business because of the concepts presented in this book. Well worth the price of the book!
__label__1 Where's the Beef?: Great concept, but much too basic for even my 9-year-old. He does need work on where to make or backup a play, but even he was done with this CD in well under an hour. I was hoping for situations where my son had to determine where the play was based on where the runners were and how many outs there were. Unfortunately, the number of outs was not factored in. This would be great for a free web-based tutorial. But for $25, it was definitely not worth it.
__label__1 WOW...i thought i was the only one!: I just happened to come across this item. I've owned this blender up until recently...I thought I had done something wrong when my blender starting smoking and burning up. I too had the same problem w/ the black plastic assembly breaking in half and melting. It was however excellent up until that point (1 yr. minimal usage). At $20 it might be worth the risk...at full price..STAY AWAY!!
__label__1 Very Dissappointed: I had a version of this farm over 40 years ago and I remember loving it. I bought one for my daughter 6 years ago and I was so pleased with how far the product had come. It was durable with many different areas of play. We gave it away when my daughter grew out of it and bought this one this year when my second daughter turned 1. I am SO disappointed! It is not made well - not as solid. There is no merry go round - something the other farm had. There is no place for the goat to be placed to hear his sound and the chicken is cannot be removed. There used to be a fence that could be constructed....it's just NOT the same toy. Additionally, I'm sure I paid less for the mode 6 years ago. What a shame. Would not pay $35 for this toy. I'm sure there is something better out there. Will be looking.
__label__1 Dull, Old, Pointless: This book could have probably been written by a 15 year old. It is linear and lacks depth. The theme has been in every low budget horror movie. I felt like McCarthy stole the four hours that it took me to read this and I was offended one particular image that he created. It was unnecessary and led me to conclude that Cormac is a sick man. His book is 250 pages of disgust that leads only the most shallow thoughts. Oprah is wrong on this one.
__label__2 Taking a Bike Ride in Hawaii: Due to a knee injury, I am unable to go out walking like I used to. An exercise bike was given to me but I hated watching television shows or listening to just music when I used the bike. I ran across the Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVDs and I was hooked. I set my bike up close to the television and started the dvd. This is a bike ride seen from the rider's view. You go biking around the Big Island of Hawaii and I am completely lost in the ride. You find yourself gazing back and forth at the sights, watching out for cars...LOL, and just take a bike ride. I encourage people to use these tapes when using your stationary bikes. It is great!
__label__1 cd player died after 5 months: not impressed, I just packed this up to ship back to sony.If I paid less for it, I would've just pitched it in the trash and avoided a sony next time. I had to deal with a voice recognition system for customer service ( how lame is that? )I was finally able to get a semi-english speaking person on the other end of the line who made me unplug\plug-in the unit to see if that would fix it... ( no, it's not a windows pc )cd players have been around for about 20 years now, it seems to me that they should be able to build a fairly reliable one at this point.
__label__2 What about the women in the story? Tell us more.: I loved the women in the story, like the Rolling Stone reporterwho called Zeppelin a bunch of animals! And the French model Charlotte Martin who was the mother of Jimmy Page's daughter. The only woman there was WAY to much about was Pamela Des Barres (if you aren't already bored by her - read her autobiography). Even Patti D'Arbanville was mentioned.I agree with the reviewer there was not enough stuff about Zepplin's time in Britain .The book was well detailed. I would have given it 5 stars if it had featured more interesting quotes from the women . Especially women rock stars - who most likely had opionions about Zeppelin.
__label__2 headline: a great guitarist shares good tips with you to learn what you need to get to be a better musician.
__label__2 Good quality, comfortable: The build quality on this seat is pretty solid, though it does use plastic screws instead of heavier duty metal ones. It feels comfortable and it's easily detached for cleaning. If it doesn't hold up or there are other problems, I'll report back. Otherwise solid product.
__label__1 Poor Quality: Received unit April 5, 2010. It was very quite and efficient when it worked. It lost its refrigerant and started freezing up and quit dehumidifying in August 2010. Even though I had only used it for four plus months, Soleus refused to pay return shipping charges to replace it under warranty. I would not recommend this unit.
__label__1 Bland illustrations, lackluster text: I bought this book in the hopes that the text would be simple enough for my four-year-old. It was simple enough, but at great cost. Details I remember from the tellings I heard as a child were missing. There was nothing in the text that would help a child even remotely empathize with the characters. Ugh. I wanted my son to like or at least remember the story, but hearing this retelling was like eating cardboard. The illustrations weren't that great either, with nothing to attract a child's eye. Get a different version!
__label__2 Great investment: I have a couple of sport bikes that I hardly ever take out during the winter months. This Battery Tender is the perfect way to save a couple of batteries over the long off season. Very easy to connect and very convenient since it has a connector that stays with the bike at all times. I am now able to keep both batteries fully charged until its time to ride again. Considering the price of a new battery, this battery tender is a must have for anyone with a couple of expensive toys!
__label__2 Every physician should read this: I bought this book because I saw it in a reference in another book. It was very interesting how a one treatment hormone can treat so many diseases. After develop adrenal fatigue(or adrenocortical deficiency the term used in the book) after a chronic stress my physician put me on 15 mg. After 2 months of the treatment my left adrenal stop to pain and is started to swell. My physician told me that that is a indication of recovery, after 5 months(now) my left adrenal is not in pain. The only error that my physician did was that he put me on a sutained release(SR) of cytomel(T3) before the cortef. I feel worse with the SR T3 even my right adrenal start to pain a lot during the mornings. But after cortef the pain was reduced feeling better after that.Now I can work and do some cardio workout that I couldn't do before. I thanks a lot to Jefferies to develop this treatment and show this to the public.
__label__2 !!!SKA AT IT'S BEST!!!!!: Wow, i was blown away by this album. The blend of punky guitar riffs, regae bass lines and piercing horns give reel big fish a sound no one else i have heard can come close to. BUY THIS CD and ALL OF RBFS OTHERS@!!!
__label__2 clipper parts: Glad I could find these parts on Amazon. I hate to buy a new clipper, when all I needed was that part. Affordable and came quick.Thanks!
__label__1 Bland and Boring: The author of this book tried to make conflicted heroes. He ended up making them all so obnoxious I wanted the zombies to get them; which isn't much of a punishment because the zombies were boring.
__label__1 Dreadful: The author wrote an interesting book on economics and technology long ago. It was published in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Then he became a tiresome and annoying fundamentalist. Since then he has written nothing worth reading. A friend gave me his copy of this title after losing interest in it by the third chapter. I managed to read the entire book on a plane ride. Unfortunately, it was the only reading material I had.If god wants you to be rich, it appears that he hates 95% of humanity because it's poor.Don't waste your time and money on this tiresome religious propaganda.Here's a far better alternative: Randy Gage's Why You're Dumb, Sick, and Broke.
__label__1 this tape is GREEN!: I had no idea this tape is a bright-chartreuse green. It's not just the packaging. It's the tape itself. I was looking for a regular color tape.
__label__2 Although it's a wonderful and helpful book...: It should really have more important information, such as a summery of costs, tips on picking the perfect horse fo lessons, hiring staff, stuff that you REALLY need to know about starting your own business. Other then that, it's really a great and imformative book.
__label__1 high energy walking: I didn't care for the music. It just didn't work for me. I like the Biggest Loser Country Hits to walk with.
__label__2 Uniden Scanner: It works very well & was priced fairly. There are a few frequencies (mostly marine) that it doesn't pick up.
__label__1 GARBAGE............: Should have read these reviews before purchasing this garbage. EASY Media Creator 9....who are they kidding. I'll have Amex call them and get my money back as I've already "uninstalled" this thing. Tech support was a joke. I really get urked when someone who is suppose to help me 'talks down' to me like I'm an 1st grader. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 The worst CD i have ever had - and i have over 3K: Unfortunately I liked one song at Pandora and sow that these CDs are relatively cheap - now know why -, so I ordered 3 of them. All were horrible, no artistic concern, no great lyrics, nothing...but this one was worst. I recommend you to listen to the sample before buying even if they are 0.01 $.
__label__2 Very Cute!: "Off the scale" cute, but the only reasons I didn't give it five stars is because (1) the video is produced in short bursts. The longest continuous filming scene is probably ten seconds, with most much shorter (that makes it sort of jumpy), and (2) the audio is "non-descript" music, not really unpleasant to listen to, but certainly not pleasant. The first scene with "Molly, Chews a Thing" shown on the cover, is nice, as all the other kittens. I DO LIKE IT, but it could have been better.
__label__1 NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!: This is advertised as a tri-ply pot -- but what I just received was an ordinary steel pot with an aluminum disk brazed to the bottom. In fact, the pot I was sent looks nothing like the one pictured: the shape is different, the lip is different, the pot is different.$99 is not a bad price for a tri-ply stock pot, but one can buy a disk-bottom pot of similar quality just about anywhere for half this price. I'd have to say this was a complete rip-off.
__label__2 I Want to Build One Now: I saw a sample of this engine at a miniature show and after seeing this book I am sure I can build one for myself.
__label__1 a basic begining: This is a good but very basic introduction to column writing. I was hoping for more. Still, it seems to be the only thing out there on the subject and it column writing is your dream it would do you well to check this book out.
__label__1 The hanging light worked for 3 months and died: I bought the Paradise hanging path light Nov. 5, 2013 and it died 5 days after Jan 390, 2013 return was allowed. Bought a new lamp, tried to replace it and still didn't work. Can't return it and no way to contact Amazon or Warehouse Deals by phone or email to complain. It was just $19.19 wasted.
__label__2 THIS C.D IS DA BOMB!! SAILOR MOON IS SOO KEWL!: Sailor Moon is THE Best Anime *Japaniese cartoon* EVER!!! We have the C.D and it is great! It is worth it! Even though "Only a Memeory Away" Is changed, it's still kewl! You get to listen to the FULL versions of the songs! Not just the ones that they put on the Episode! You GOTA buy it!
__label__1 filling but not tasty: Well, it's filling, and fairly low-calorie at 140 for the bar. I had high hopes for this bar, given the promise of fruit and nuts, which is reinforced by the packaging that prominently features pictures of raisins, almonds, peanuts and cranberries. Opening the package is the first of the disappointments. The primary ingredient is oats, followed closely by corn syrup. Tiny specks of cranberry, raisin and almond, with a few peanut chunks. The flavor is very sweet with a bitter aftertaste. This is not a product I would recommend or choose to purchase.
__label__1 VERY DISGUSTING!: This film is stupider than the first. How on earth can people like this crap? The writting, the plot, etc., they all sucked rotten eggs! Films like this should be thrown in the furnace to burn fast! Stay away!
__label__1 Too Small: The case is too small for the Street Pilot 2610. When I travel I need the Street Pilot and the cord to plug into the lighter. also need the "sand bag". It won't fit. Buy a bigger case.
__label__2 Irreplaceable and Necessary: John Simon is, along with Robert Brustein and Stanley Kauffmann, one of America's three greatest drama critics, and my personal favorite. I've learned an enormous amount from him over the years. If you're willing to do so, you will too.
__label__2 Not on iTunes: I was a forced to buy the whole CD for one song. This CD is not available on iTunes, I guess because the music is so old. After buying it I found another song on the CD I really like, and those two songs really are worth the whole purchase price.
__label__2 If you want to see a child laugh- read this book!: I read this book to my 4 year old daughter and she could not stop LAUGHING! The illustrations are not traditional yet captivating and the overall content is HILARIOUS. The content provides opportunity to extend the story and laughs. I have read other "funny" quality children's books but the laughter that came out of my child was like no other after reading this book! Definitly a part of our personal library!
__label__1 Absolutely dreadful: This book had a lot of potential, from the interesting cover, to the premise on the back. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was disjointed, confusing, underdeveloped (plot and characters) and boring. It lacked a strong plot and had little resolution at the end. The author had more fun describing the lead female basically as a sexual object than a mature adult. The sexual overtones were unnecessary and distracting. His attempts to keep the reader in the dark were so confusing that I never knew what was going on, which "plot" to focus on or which decade to be in. All in all, a terrible "thriller."
__label__1 Very Dissapointing: I bought these headphones to ease the bordem while swimming laps. They sound great for about 10 seconds when you first submerge your head. As soon as you start to turn your head from side to side while swimming, the seal leaks, fills up your ear with water, and the sound disappears. I tried trimming the ear piece (didn't work). I also tried adding a ring of silicone around the earpiece (as suggested by the manufacturer) and that lasted for less than one length of the pool and my ears filled up again. The headphones were also very uncomfortable. Don't waste your money on this!!!
__label__2 excellence: Excellent. Although fiction- the references are impeccable. Yes. this kind of crime really happens. Including the Montreal Dr.Cameron. I have lived approximately as long as the author- and have seen, heard,watched and read about the events of which she writes.Heard some from my students- and my own children.Cameron- the survivors of his experiments are among us- I live in Quebec province- Required reading for anyone interested in promoting an ethical society. Nowadays it is alienation theories and divorce etc.- the latest form of the cruelty the author describes-.i.e.- in many cases, a mother reports incest/child abuse. She and child not believed- custody goes to abuser.
__label__2 Corduroy: a lesson in unconditional love.: Books bring us enjoyment, but they should also teach us as well. Corduroy does just that. A little bear who is not perfect (having lost his button) is accepted and loved by a little girl just because.....just because. Unconditional love, how can that be more endearing?
__label__1 Big Hit or Big Miss: Depending on how you feel about the role of music in Northern Exposure, this collection is either a Big Hit or a Big Miss for you. Universal has completely and utterly given up on even trying to provide meaningful music for these episodes, let alone the songs originally aired. In some places, they've picked out the sappiest, most irritating music sitting around in the archives.If you are drawn to the characters and stories, you'll enjoy these episodes. I've been moved by the stories, I'm drawn into the character's lives, and I have thoroughly enjoyed returning to this program. The music is very important to me, but the stories more so. I'm resigned to living without.But if the music made this show for you, don't buy this product. Your heart will be broken and you'll feel sorry for these characters being so completely disrespected living life to such extraordinarily aweful music.This is a one if the music matters, a four if it doesn't.
__label__2 People thought I was a real nun: I wore this costume to a charity event and while walking to and from the event, I had people stop and ask me if they could get my picture with them. They thought I was a real nun. The actual event involved me swimming in seawater for an extended period of time and this costume not only held up, but I'll be wearing it to the same event again next year. This is a great value and a purchase I would recommend.
__label__2 A talent waiting to be discovered: I discovered this book while doing a web search for new horror written by relatively unknown writers. I ordered a copy and was not disappointed. Ms. Mikhall definitely knows how to spin a good yarn, and her writing skills are solid. All in all a very entertaining pair of stories. I look forward to more from the author.
__label__2 FUNNY: I saw this episode on cartoon network and loved it. And I still love it. It is kinda like the old looney tunes but makes more sense and is really funny. You see because Bugs bunny and, Daffy duck are trying to win a contest about best friends but the creators of the show made daffy have short term memory lose. But the episode is really funny like when they Bugs refrences superman and daffy says you're from krypton and bugs says no thats superman and daffy says who is superman and bugs says daffy focus and daffy says okay superman. I think you should buy this episode. Me and my mom accidently bought this episode. But that is all I have to say. (I am toni's son).
__label__1 They're not black!: I ordered these straps to go on a boat with a black bimini top. The picture shows straps that are black. What I received were straps that are white! I did not use them, so I don't even know what the quality is like or if they work. Very disappointed. I needed these on short notice and the opportunity to use them was lost.
__label__1 Deaver loses plot: I'm with the other reviewer who gave this two stars. In Stone Monkey the 'surprise' bad guy was all too obvious because you know that's what Deaver does, but with the Vanished Man Deaver really starts to unravel. For me the story has to be crdible, and far too many scenes in this novel had me shaking my head in disbelief. He still writes in an enjoyable way, and his characters are still a little flat, but this had none of the tension of the Bone Collector and all the signs of someone who really is trying to be far too clever for his own - or his readers' - good.
__label__2 A good, fun and quick read.: This was an excellent read. Fun, engaging and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The only criticism one might have is that the book would make a good start for further character and plot development with a trilogy or a series.
__label__1 Full of glaring omissions: As a staunch conservative, I gave this book a try. It does contain some very good information that most textbooks leave out. However this is all overshadowed by several glaring omissions.Glaring Omission #1: Andersonville. In Dr. Woods rush to blame the entire Civil War on the evil North while make South out to be saint like. He even makes the claim that Robert E. Lee was able for the most part to keep the Confederate Army within the boundaries of the civilized laws of war. Dr. Woods seems to forget the Andersonville prison camp and other Southern atrocities while making sure to mention Northern ones.Glaring Omission #2: The Zimmerman Telegram. In Dr. Woods's zeal to blame all of World War I on Woodrow Wilson, he forgets to even mention the Zimmerman Telegram.Another claim that is dubious at best: FDR's refusal to meet with the `moderate' Japanese Prime Minister led to the fall of the moderates and rise of militarism. I guess invading China is `moderate' to Dr. Woods.
__label__1 For the love of money: This movie was way over rated. The idea was fun and a few of the characters were ok but overall wait for Netflix
__label__2 get your heart rate up!: I am soooooo tired of seeing the words "sloppy with her cues" - Oh Pleeeeze - I have been working out with Denise for over 15 years - and found this to be one of her better work outs. I can not think of any trainer on DVD/Vidoe that has not screwed up somewhere in the work out!A work out is only as good as the effort you put into it! That said this is not for the beginner - if you do not know your basic moves this may be a bit fast paced for you. I HATE the "kick box" type of work out - my sister who is a HUGE fan of it bought this (she is not a Denise fan) and loved it so much she bought it for me. I would rcommend this for anyone who has been exercising to DVD/Videos for a while.
__label__1 This Vampire Sucks: Do not waste your time on this DVD. It might have been a "classic" back in its time (1971), but it has not aged well.
__label__1 MAYBE FAME HAS RUINED THIS BAND: It's almost like these guys gave up and decided to cash paychecks instead of writing inspired music... I am really bummed out about this release. I hope they get a kick in the head from all the bad reviews and do some REAL song writing instead of going through the motions.The single was just okay, but the rest of this CD is really bad. Maybe chicks dig it, but I have to pass. Hope for a better release next time...
__label__1 Write this only for the justice of some good author: Poor plot if there is any real effort in it,poor content, nothing new!
__label__2 good: When I got this book I was so happy because I needed to know more about Selena and this book has it all. Great pictures and it get you the inside scoop on Tejano Leading Lady.
__label__2 Now I can work at night without a lamp on!: The Saitek Backlit Keyboard is just what I needed to be able to work through the night without a lamp on (that was bothering my husband trying to sleep in the same room).It is smooth to type on, you can control the level of brightness--even turn it off if you like. I switched from a larger profile keyboard, so the closer keys was something I had to get used to, but am fine with it now.The only thing that could be improved are that the legs for propping do not lock and often collapse.... oh well, reach under and pop it back into place... not that hard.Anyway, it suits my needs for a great price. I am happy!
__label__1 Awful fit: I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with. I did this because of the price and it was money wasted. The bras fit as if it had been worn. Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right. So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist. Useless. Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill. Bad purchase. Bad fit. Pretty but not practical. I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well, this was not made for D+ women.
__label__2 Stuck watching Disney: Having three little girls that believe they are all princesses I have to endure many Disney movies. Enchanted is different from many other Disney movies in that it kind of makes fun of the basic FairyTale formula Disney has relied upon for years. As an adult male with the children I found the movie funny and I laughed in places my kids did not get. For having to sit through this on a long drive it was pretty good. Despite not having any car chases or fiery explosions I still liked it.
__label__1 Nice idea, wish mine worked: The card reader I got doesn't work; cards don't feed. It feeds the calibration sheet, and that's it. It just grinds away doing nothing when I put a card in. The "online support" has an FAQ with one entry in it. Why bother?Support is lame, 9-5 Eastern. As I live in CA, that's not really acceptable.
__label__2 This is Christmas: I can not imagine Christmas without this disc. When I think about that joyous time of year, this is the soundtrack.
__label__2 Off the Couch: I dread exercising. I hate it more than anything in this world. However this game has me doing it. It has several different levels of difficulty so even as we start to improve we will still have challenges for a very long time to come. I would recommend this to people who are looking for a way to get active without having to deal with busy gyms or workout groups.
__label__1 Can't understand the instructions: Have been unable to use the GPS to find out how many miles I've hiked on trails in the mountains because I don't understand the instructions.
__label__2 Great to Own!: Was a nice family tradition of ours to purchase all the 7th Heaven Series and watch them at our leisure, long trips, late nights, etc. Nice way to bring our family together, wind down, and have something moral to keep us focused. Good examples. Good memories. Wise move to order these!
__label__1 What a pity: What a pity to have collected so wonderful pieces of music of this legend singer, and to permanently cover her music with plenty of verbiage without interest, with a few exceptions of some short films and part of Joan herself interview.Why not to have a separate track for only the music band - that you would like to enjoy many times - and one for the comments and interview - that you will listen to only once (maximum)? instead of this frustating mix.
__label__2 My Sony Walkman Am Fm Radio/Casette/tv/ weather band: Awesome sound, power, bought ear buds for just a bit better sound, but very pleased with the product. Had one previously but was left on an airplane and never found.
__label__2 THIS CD IZ LIKE DA BIBLE 2 ME (A MUST FOE ALL PLAYA/PIMPS: If u wanna know whats REALLY goin on n da dirty south, get this cd main. Thats right, nathan but pimpin,playin,mackin&jackin down here. wit all that weak **** comin out now, this cd gets better every damn year.NOBODY HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO PUT PIMPIN DOWN ON WAX AS HARDCORE AND PURE AS THESE ******. AND I DOUBT ANYBODY EVER WILL!!!!!!
__label__1 What an ego!: If he's such a hot-shot, why does he have the time to write a book? Shouldn't he be trading
__label__1 Works a few years, then doesnt: The toaster is great, but...BUT the flaw is that the weakest point is the lift for the toast. It broke the first time under warranty. We drove it 40 min.away to fix for free, returning to retrieve the same 40 min away. It has broken again. So for a few years, is fine. For the money, not so fine.
__label__2 Captivating and Great Story telling...: Once more David Gemmell catches my imagination... but Winter Warriors is a cut above other Drenai Sagas. I liked Legend a lot... but this book goes a step further ! Gemmell is a master and this book brings his world back to life... with new myths and new legends in the making.I can't recommend this book enough. Hard to stop reading.
__label__1 Disappointing: I bought this and was really pumped to re watch the series again. Got it in 4 days to Australia which was amazing. When I got the box set first I was shocked at the packaging which is 2 book type things set next to each other in a box. The DVD are not separated into seasons so you have to guess what episodes you want to watch. The biggest issue is the packaging on the set in which the dvd's become basically unwatchable. The set looks great on the shelf and once I get the discs buffed it will be a lot better. Amazon where very helpful in dealing with the problem.
__label__1 Rendered 'unavailable' to many!: I really wanted to see this. With all the technology available today I do not understand why this is not Closed Captioned! Makes it impossible and unavailable to me and I'm sure to so many others!
__label__1 Don't know how it got high reviews: We adjusted the sensitivity, didn't do much. My 2 yr old daughter prompted some sounds when she wacked the buttons. The reviews make this sound like a wonderful engaging toy. After the first 14 seconds of investigation my daughter turned to other things. I tried to return but Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days and I ordered it earlier as a gift and didn't bother opening it before that. Now I'm stuck with it, wasted my money, especially after spending money for additional cartridges, as well.
__label__1 In Search of Mozart: It is a bit ponderous. I ordered it for my AP English Language and Composition Class, and I am afraid that it will not be what they need to analyze it for Documentary as Rhetoric. While I can appreciate its beauty, they will probably be bored.
__label__2 Fantastic magazine with excellent photography and stories: To me, Saveur is almost more about travel than it is about food. The articles tend to be about cuisines set in the context of their geographic and cultural origins. Rich photography and personal stories give you a flavor of the people and places behind familiar and new dishes. Articles in Saveur have inspired me to take several trips, to places I would not have otherwise considered, and seek out amazing little hole in the wall shops and restaurants.If you love to travel, cook, and eat, you will love Saveur!
__label__1 Quality problem: I use this cooker for 2 years. It was smoking yesterday. I open it then find out that the CPU "Sanyo 789445-539" has been burned & smoked.
__label__2 Double Goodness: I have to confess that I only heard the first Pure Prairie League album a few months ago when I picked up this two-for disc. I had "Bustin' Out" and "Two Lane Highway" back when they came out in the 70s and loved them both, but the band's debut had someone escaped my attention over the years. My loss. That first album, as I now realize, was very, very good; a tight collection of country-rock gems such as "Tears" and "Brand New Harmony Songs." Anyone who liked "Bustin' Out" should find the first album enjoyable also. As for "If the Shoe Fits," it's pretty darn good too. This album came after Craig Fuller left the band, and was also released after "Two Lane Highway" (which I personally think is one of this band's masterpieces). I could do without the cover of Buddy Holly's "That'll Be the Day," but most of the material on here is quite nice, following the same melodic country-rock groove found on their previous albums. Very listenable.
__label__2 Just adding to the stars...: Not much to say about this amazing record. Has been my favorite Willie album since its release. Just wanted to add another 5 stars!
__label__2 ALL ABOUT TECHNIQUES IN AIRBRUSH: I'm just beginning to learn how to use an airbrush and this book gave me alot of useful information about the different types of airbrushes and how to use them.
__label__1 Cheap and lousy.: This book was presented as Taras Bulba by Gogol. It shows up to be a collection of stories printed in the cheapest way possible. It does not mention who translated the stories to English. It looks like some college student made a hasty compendium for his Gogol class.This is not only cheap it is much too cheap.
__label__1 Not satisfied: The Flavas dolls are not educational at all. It is disapointing to find the doll is not like the commericial at all. It sat on my shelf the whole time, and never once did i feal anxcious to play with it after it was opeaned . I would advise you to think before you buy, will it be fun? or will it be a waste of money?The only good thing i can think of is it would be durable for "rough" play or for a young child.-Not Satisfied!!!!!
__label__1 Its Sanctum shall be the previously viewed clearance bin: The only reason it got 2 stars was because the the picture and audio quality were superb.The movie itself is boring and annoying in a Aussie accent in a informercial type of way.The 'Cave' genre is a pretty niche market. Only one movie to really watch in this category and The Descent is the benchmark for claustrophobes and horror fiends.
__label__1 How did this happen?: I intended to buy 3 mugs, each of a different color.If the order page default for these mugs is Item 1, how did this happen?Note that this is not a comment on the quality of the mugs(solicited by Amazon) NOR is it a comment on the quality of your packing(also solicited by Amazon). This is a comment on the quality of your Ordering Process (solicitation Notably Absent).A modest proposal - Speedy Delivery as all who have grown up exposed to "Mr. Rogers neighborhood" know is a desirable attribute. However I suggest that you present a relatively uncluttered Order Review/Confirmation page exhibiting prominently (highlighting, reverse contrast blinking, etc.) the actual Selections (benefits) and the costs & cost total. This action will make clear that you have the customer's best interests in mind as well as your own.I will likely keep the extra mug,A loyal customer - Harryrotatun@yahoo.comTWIMC
__label__1 Same Problem Reported By Others: As others have reported in the past, the projected numbers on this clock are now illegible and can no longer be read.This expensive clock is NOT a good value. I cannot recommend it because based on my experience (and others), you will almost certainly have to replace it before long.
__label__1 How can a movie drag so?: Oh my gosh! This movie. I saw this a little bit after it came to DVD. I really have to say this movie is horrible. HORRIBLE! Ryan Reynolds is like a total playboy and doesn't know what he wants like 3/4 through the movie. Also, it is long. Too long! In the middle, it drags like nobody's business. Just alternating between the 3 ladies that he is involved with. Just choose dude!!
__label__2 Great bar, shipping can be a little rough: Bar is great/sturdy/as spec'd; got scuffed on one end during shipping, but I didn't buy it for looks. Much better than trying to buy a cheapo bar at Walmart and then fitting (or not) it into my small car.
__label__1 Frosty??????????????: Uh, just for the record...FROSTY has a BUTTON nose!!!! Not a carrot!! This must be Frosty's lame-o cousin Freezy!!
__label__2 Book for my daughter: When my daughter was in collage, she and a friend occasionally wandered through cemeteries to read the epitaphs. This was a perfect birthday book for her. She spent most of the time during her birthday dinner reading to us from it.
__label__2 What else can you say? It's Stevie Ray: The man was to a Stratocaster what Itzhak Perlman is to a Stradivarius. 'Nuff said.
__label__1 "We must kill our brothers": I really enjoyed the movie (1990) with Anthony Quinn as Santiago. So I decided it was time to read the book. Well I found the book and the movie paralleled pretty well. How ever I was getting bored with the book it seemed a bit repetitive. The old man kept going on and on about Joe Dimaggio's bone spur.There were a few places that made me squeamish. One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish. He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)The reader helps bring the story to life.The Old Man and the Sea ~ Anthony Quinn
__label__1 Should have looked here first: I didn't buy this on Amazon, but I see that everyone else bought the same one I did. I should have checked here first, at the very least. My parents had a great little toaster oven for years, it was all grimy and black inside, but it worked perfectly. Then they got a new shiny one (crappy) and gave me their old one. But now being 3000 miles away and in need of a new one, I forgot the lessons of my past, and bought a random cheap toaster oven (this one). Like everyone else said, there's no notice of toast finishing. Bells are how expensive? The thing heats up to a ridiculous degree. I'm sure if I ever spaced out and set something paper on top I'd burn my house down. The tray? It warps every single time I use it. Doesn't seem to have affected my food, but it's freaky to see two of the corners pointed up almost up to the little roof. I guess actual metal is too expensive too.How I pine for the toaster oven of my youth...
__label__1 There is a reason no one uses these anymore.: God bless those pioneering women who had muscles like steel bands to crank a grinder handle for hours and the unexplained need to make meat mush from otherwise good meat. This has to be one of the worst retro-technology products that I have ever come across. From cutter blades that couldn't cut soft cheese without making fondue, it to parts that must have been cast from the thousandth recast of the original. Nothing fits well, nothing works well . . . in general it belongs where you see most of them, on a table at a garage sale with a $0.25 price tag. Don't waste your time, money or musclepower.
__label__1 Piece of Junk!: Do not purchase these clips. They are less than worthless. The "adhesive" backing didn't even last for 48 hours. You'd be better off duct-taping the curtain to the wall!
__label__1 Stupid, stupid, stupid: What a rip off this book was!!! I can't believe the effort this author went through just to deceive these islanders and make a quick buck. My advice ... don't bother reading this book. Shame on her.
__label__1 Dull and Out of Tune, Just as Vol 1: I would like to say that this recording was an improvement over Volume 1, which I found to be rather annoyingly out of tune (Ms. See) and hideously dull (all except Ms. Springfels). I see that the price on this set just keeps dropping and dropping, probably soon to be remaindered altogether. These are very significant works that deserve a much more invigorating and imaginative treatment than they are given here.
__label__1 Same Advice Grandpa Gave Me: Reading this book is like eating leftovers. Warmed over finacial basics. The author offers few fresh ideas and certainly nothing that will even mildly improve my life style.Someone will live better if you buy this book, it just won't be you.
__label__1 Waste of Money!!!: Don't waste your money on these UMD holders. Altoid Sours tins or Ice Breakers tins work just as well. You only pay $1.75 for each one, and you get candy. They can hold 2 UMDs like these can. So, instead of paying $5 + shipping, just buy 2 Altoid Sours for $3.50!!!!!!
__label__2 Good Sharpener: The Lansky diamond sharpens very well. Diamond stones are very nice and give a precise edge. The case is one of the worst designs and I don't understand how the folks at Lansky have not figured that out yet. Rods stick in the grips, which require prying to break them free. I have bent all the rods trying to get them out. This impacts the preciseness of the edge when your guide rod is bowed.
__label__2 A story of moral conviction and justice for young readers: Just Call Me Joe Joe begins the biblical passage John 10:3, "...and the sheep shall hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name." Written especially for African-American children ages 6-10 by Jean Alicia Elster and nicely illustrated in color by Nicole Tadgell, Just Call Me Joe Joe is the story of a 10-year-old African-American boy who must deal with a shop owner who mistakenly assumes that Joe Joe was part of the gang who just trashed the store. Joe Joe must find the courage and spirit to return and convince the shop owner of the truth. Just Call Me Joe Joe is a highly recommended and strong story of moral conviction and justice for young readers.
__label__1 Sigh. Wish the studios would get it.: Extended versions of the films are a requirement.iTunes compatible digital copy is a requirement.There's no way I'd consider until both are addressed.
__label__1 amateur photographer: I purchased this product because I was tired of my nose being pressed against my display screen. I thought I was ordering an extension, but sadly I found out it was just an eye piece which already was on my camera. I have a Canon 50D. If you lost your eye piece, then this is what you need. If you are looking for an extension, then keep on looking. It's truly not Amazon's fault. I am new to the digital camera world and learning the myriad of linguo as I go.
__label__2 Mind Opening...: This book is not only eye-opening to the realities of the limits of our natural resouces it is also mind-opening to the business opportunities that are available if one is knowledgeable of where to look. This book provides a great framework for profitable businesses that are simultaneously good for the only planet earth that we have. I would encourage the authors to produce a more updated version with more recent statistics and examples. The framework itself is timeless though.
__label__2 good: the prisma coloress blender is very goodI an study fashion design, this product serves me to make my illustrationsj
__label__2 Available for free from Adobe: While perhaps not the the full-blown version, Adobe is making CS2 available for download. Great if you're on a budget
__label__1 Coleman Jumpstart system: Unfortunately the product was defective. The company was very customer friendly.I did not have any problem returning it for credit.
__label__1 dont buy this phone: this phone sucks! has no range at all. i have a business, so i need a phone that has range. when you go past 15 ft. from the base you start to hear static.
__label__1 Dot.con is the worst book I've ever read: This book is so full of bad information it just blows me away. What is presented as fact in the book is simply not true. I don't know where the author came up with the information he did. It is pure vapor.This book was not just poorly written but it is full of gramatical and spelling errors. Hello spell check!A waste of money.
__label__2 Bruce Lee Book Review: The book is a great read for those that are little interested in the martial arts or who have great knowledge of the art. It shows the great mind of Bruce Lee and his many ideas,thoughts and philosophies, which at times could confuse the reader. The reader must remember the author was speaking in various aspects of a person views. Lee tries to let the reader understand its not always about the set of rules,regulations and routines but rather which you as an individual can utilize the best for yourself. Overall this is a great book and remember to have an open mind about philosophical views that maybe quite different from yourselves.
__label__2 Khaki Mafia - worth reading: Before you totally disregard this book please take a minute to Google Robin Moore's credentials. True, this is historical fiction. The names have been replaced but it's easy enough to research the actual participants. This is a story of mismanagement, greed and inadequate supervision that takes place mostly during the Vietnam War. The really sad part is that the funding that was intended for American troops on the front lines were siphoned away by "Saigon Queens" and contractors who were only after a profit fr themselves. Greed and corruption are occuring even today in our current Middle eastern conflicts at the expense of our Soldiers and Marines. We need someone with backbone in the State Department and DoD to cut these leeches off.
__label__1 Warning about this one: This may be an isolated incident, but just in case...We bought this card and it did not work properly. The computer seemed to recognize the card without problems, but the USB ports would not recognize the devices we plugged into it. We tried a 1GB USB flash drive and our digital camera, both of which work well with the old (slower) USB drives. Whenever we tried to use the ports, the computer (which runs on Windows XP) would freeze up. Our problem is not listed in the (very short) user manual troubleshooting guide. Their website is disappointing and we're not in the mood for waiting for customer service, so we're returning ours.Again, this may very well be an isolated incident. Good luck with your card.
__label__2 Very Realistic and an Excellent Novel: I am currently reading the book and am more than half way done with it. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It is very descriptive in details and has very realistic characters. The book makes you think that the characters are real and the story really took place. This is a page-turner that will be so enjoyable to read that you won't be able to put down until you finish it.
__label__2 HIGHLY RECOMMEND: My husband and I felt intimidated about pouring our own concrete slab foundation and weren't sure if we could even do it ourselves. We did a bunch of research but weren't finding anything that was making us feel comfortable with taking on such a project. We ended up buying this Guide DVD and are SO happy we did! The instructor, Andrew, gave very detailed step-by-step instructions we felt were easy to follow.We also were inspired after watching the video to stamp the slab while it was still wet. The end results are beautiful and our outdoor concrete deck looks like it was poured by a professional crew. We get so many compliments on it and we're very proud of the job we were able to do.Doing it ourselves, in the end, probably saved us about $3,000!! And it was fun and all our friends are VERY impressed. I would definitely recommend this as the first resource for building a monolithic concrete slab.
__label__2 excellent boot - especially if you dislike lacing and unlacing to get the boot on and off: The boot is warm, water resistant and once you set up the laces, you use the zipper to get the boot on and off.
__label__2 Used for a DigiTech JML2 JamMan Stereo Looper: To get the full functionality out of the JamMan, my son needed this switch.Like all of the DigiTech pedals and switches, this one is well-built and sturdy.My son is still integrating the use of the JamMan into his music and it and the three-button switch have only just been added to his pedal board. But we expect this combo to last YEARS.
__label__2 NENA Nur getraeumt Hits: I recently ordered this CD and love it. Being born and raised in Germany, what I especially like about this CD is that Hit song 99 Luftballons is on there in the original version and not in the English version which is not as good in my opinion.The songs are mostly party like, upbeat music that is easy to listen to.
__label__2 A wonderful classic: I LOVED this show when it was on! I thought John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays were terrific! Unfortunately, I think it was a tad too "campy" for most people - even back in 1990. Thus, it only lasted one season.I picked this up as soon as it came out and I love it! The episode with Mark Hamill as the Trickster is exceptional. One can easily see how this character might have led to his recurring voice-work as the Joker on the Batman Animated series.The other thing I had completely forgotten about this show that I really dig, though, is all the classic cars! They went for a sort of new world/old world style to the sets and there are TONS of gorgeous classic cars all over the place!This show was a classic and it provides a fond rememberance of life in the early '90's.
__label__2 Stephanie's Back: After the disappointing Hard Eight and Visions of Sugar Plums, I'm glad to not only see Stephanie back, but no cars were demolished (getting old), she seems to be getting better at the apprehension aspect (about time) and she's finally learning to take care of herself. I also liked her relationships with Joe and Ranger much better in To the Nines -- I didn't think they treated her very well in Hard Eight. There are a lot of great moments in this newest outing, but I think one of my favorites is when Lulu(?) thinks she's growing fangs from eating so much meat.
__label__2 Simple easy to use: The product works as advertised, and is very simple to use. I am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a Spirit Box for use in investigations for my paranormal research group.
__label__2 Great, great, great!: After watching "Sugar: The Bitter Truth" lecture by Dr. Robert Lustig, I immediately threw out all of my honey, sugar, Agave syrup, and corn syrup!! I now only use Glucose (Dextrose) for sweetening drinks and using in baking. The only thing it doesn't do well as a substitute for is confectioner sugar for making frosting, but otherwise I use this 100% in my food now. No more fructose for me except when it's accompanied by fiber like in fruits. I'm so glad there's this healthy alternative.
__label__2 If she really is "Free" I'd Take her... :): This song was by far Mya's best song released from her bazillion selling album "Fear of Flying." It wasn't as popular as "Case of the Ex" but I thought "Free" is better. I really like Mya's mix of Pop and Disco-ish background music. It really sounds different in today's Pop world. I don't think Mya would really be qualified as an R&B Artist...and she's not yet Pop. She has a good mix and gives off a good vibe. The video is Hot as well...which includes awsome roller skating choreography! Way to go Mya and I can't wait 4 ur next album!
__label__2 earplug review: I'm a (no longer young) carpenter and would like to preserve what hearing I have left. I've tried many different earplugs and the main issue is comfort! I wear these things for hours at a time and the QB300 with the band are comfortable and convienent to put on and take off repeatedly. The only reason they don't get five stars is that they are supposed to be washable , but I haven't had any success is that area.
__label__2 Family reunion: A great history story and visit with family long gone and somenot so long gone and many still here. As you read the accounts from the residents you will also become a part of their family with the same hopes and fears. And admiration for the strength and determination of these early pioneers of South Florida.
__label__2 Huge, you will know almost everything about the WWII !: Excelent book, very well written. The book is HUGE, with more than one thousand pages (!), but it is no boring at all. It is very complete, covering all the facts from the years before the WWII start, until some years after its ending. It puts you in each important fact place and time, explaining the real situation that leads to each movement. The chapters are well splited, that means you won't loose the main idea, eve if you read a chapter per month (for example). It is very reach in details, tolding even about the personal life aspects of each main piece who somehow had an important impact on the greatest war ever. The author did a exemplary research and every information is based on historical researches, on wich he indicates mostly the sources of it. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Better off with another set of clubs: I learned how to juggle clubs with these clubs and I was not impressed by them. The top knobs fell off of two of them from casual practice over carpet in a matter of weeks. They are completely hollow and have no balance to them.I'd go for the clubs made by duncan, they're about the same price but of a better quality, mine have lasted years of abuse and held up fine, minus minor scratches from drops over concrete. They are also much better weighted and balanced.
__label__1 Pay Attention: Pay more attention than I did. This game is designed to run on WINDOWS95. Do not buy it if you are running WindowsXP. I'm going to try to send it back.
__label__1 Sorry, do not waste your money: Sorry, do not waste your money. The button does not work after a few times of useage. Surprised for its quanlity.
__label__1 Justice !!: When are the HILDEBRANDT BROTHERS going to get the proper acknowledgement by the makers of this film concerning their influence on the TOTAL look of this and the other films by Of Peter Jackson ?!!!??
__label__1 No batteries: Coleman has discontinued this product and if your battery happens to work now, it won't in a year or two. There are no replacement batteries ANYWHERE. DON'T buy this product!
__label__2 A great book for friends to share!: A POEM A DAY is a great book to give a friend, but be sure to buy one for yourself too! That way you can share your thoughts about the poem you read every day! If you are daunted by the thought of sitting down and reading a whole book of poetry - take heart! Anyone can manage to read ONE poem a day.
__label__1 Came with a torn page: Great Classic book but damaaged.Book was in good condition except there was a torn page. Too bad because it was a gift.
__label__1 Helped me beat the Inkblot test: I read this *years* ago, and ended up sort of memorizing what to look for in the Rorschardt (spelling?) Inkblot test.I was Court-ordered to have a Psychological evaluation (aren't Ex-spouses *great*?) in Dec of 1998, and I think knowing what to say (and what *not* to say) in that portion of the test helped give me custody of my kids, rather than my insane ex-spouse.BTW: do NOT say you see a 'giant man stomping on you with big boots!'
__label__1 Biased: After reading this book, I never thought there could be such a biased book on history. Not once did Jennings talk about the Italian people and how they effected America. The inventions the Italian made, the famouse people. He did not even have the decency to give a brief page or two about the mafia. Instead he talks about prohibition from an Irish point of view? He could of at least said that the Italians were the largest minority to send men over to fight for America in World War 2. I feel this book is biased toward other nationalities as well.
__label__2 A western Classic: This is another classic western released by Timeless Media Group.They had released versions of this series before, but they were selected episodes from each season.Here they have released the complete first two seasons.I hope they will release the rest.Another nice touch from this company it that they release these series in special embossed collectible tins which is very impressive.There is also an interview with Dale Robertson on this DVD.This is a well known western so I won't go into detail about the show.But I would like to say that I am enjoying watching this series once again.Action-packed all the way.If you like westerns you'll like this.It's everything that a western should be.
__label__2 A Mahler First To Consider: [From WETA's Mahler survey]Otmar Suitner's 1963 LP for the East German VEB Schallplatten (People's-Owned Company - Records) with the Staatskapelle Dresden is the only truly exciting "First" that I have recently discovered for myself (save Haitink/CSO). Superb, rich mono sound, compelling conducting, wild climaxes, musicality and frenzy in perfect balance. Little wonder Berlin Classics has re-issued this on their "Eterna Collection"--both as a heavy vinyl LP and a beautifully produced CD with the original cover and liner notes. It further helps this release that it is coupled with an equally--or even more--gorgeous rendition of the "Songs of a Wayfarer". The (East-) Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra under Kurt Sanderling and booming roundness of Herrmann Prey were recorded in 1961 and it'd all be a perfect match were it not for the considerable distortion. All the same a true joy to listen to.[Top 5 Recording of Mahler Firsts]
__label__1 Don't bother: This is state of the art (circa 1850) anti-Catholic style higher criticism of the Bible at last applied by "Catholic" scholars. No opportunity is missed to suggest that the books of the New Testament were probably not written by the traditionally attributed authors. A particularly obnoxious example is the contention that Colossians was certainly not written by Paul (even though Colossians explicitly names Paul as the author). No opportunity is missed to suggest that the texts we have are probably distorted, incomplete, etc. The most grating example is the helpful rearrangement of Philippians, showing the text not as the Bible has it, but as 'scholars' have decided it was probably originally arranged. If you don't believe in Christianity and don't hold the Bible in any particular reverence and think that the Jesus Seminar is really cutting edge theology, this is a good example of Catholic scholars trying to join the club. For all others, pick something else. Please.
__label__1 horrible keyboard: This keyboard is awful. The shift key on one side is difficult to press. And the number keys across the top have now started to intermittently stop working altogether. Should have sent back right away when I realized the shift key was sticky but didn't and now doesn't seem worth the money to send back for a partial refund. Wish i'd saved the money here and bought something that worked - would put an exclamation point there but can't b/c that key doesn't work.
__label__1 good cable, needs better RJ-45 connectors: When I received this cable i thought all would be awesome, however then I started using it with my laptop and the RJ-45(ethernet) connectors became loose and lost a lot of contact with the wires. Had i kept using it as i needed to, around my bedroom carrying my laptop from bed to desk to chair, etc then it would have fully pulled out. I recommend the snagless variety that has special fixings on the ends to ensure durability.Belkin A3L791-S 50-Foot RJ45 CAT 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable (Gray)
__label__2 Get it while you still can!: If you are a real INXS fan and want to get them on video, get this now. It is essentially the last INXS video available, though none of us know why. The footage is great and the overview and videos are spectacular! Watching it reminds you of just how cool Michael Hutchence and the band's music is. I've already got two copies and I suggest that if you really like the band that you do the same. This, unfortunately, is probably it. Who would have thought, in this great country of technology and availability, that it is vitually impossible to obtain music and music videos! Get this now!
__label__2 Hauntingly beautiful: I have 4 different CDs of monks chanting so it's a given that I like this kind of chanting. I wasn't sure I would like a single monk chanting as much as I do a group, but this is so meditative and hauntingly beautiful. Listen to the samples provided here and you will see.
__label__1 Disappointment.: The sound was inferior--tinny to a degree that was downright irritating. It seemed cheaply built with flimsy materials, and it's silly not to include an adapter cable for using other brands of MP3 players. These cables are very inexpensive and would eliminate the need for another, separate order; I didn't notice that it wasn't included. Fortunately, my son had extra cable and the iLuv worked fine with my Creative Zen Nano. The sound was just too lousy, though, and I returned the product. Amazon refunded my purchase immediately. In my experience, their customer service is terrific.
__label__1 A laughably overrated group: I remember hearing this album back when it debuted in the mid-70s. My first reaction was no reaction. After experiencing truly remarkable groups like The Who, Cream, Hendrix and of course, The Beatles, I found Bad Company to be, at best, a decent-sounding garage band. A group lacking originality, depth of lyrical content, personality, and ear-catching musicianship, I found listening to them to be a dull, enduring experience. And, by the way, the first "supergroup" was indeed Cream and certainly not this one. And Simon Kirke a great drummer? Come on-Keith Moon was the greatest rock drummer of all time, in my opinion. Paul Rodgers a great rock singer in his time? I think the Who's Roger Daltrey had him beat easily. Bad Company should have called themselves "Sominex" instead. Why? Well...you know the answer why.
__label__1 Not worth Anything: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!! I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS.......
__label__1 Disappointing: While I appreciate the author's effort, I am greatly disappointed. Llywelyn Fawr is one of my favorite subjects. I was delighted to see a new work come out, but now I wish I had not purchased it. After three attempts to read this book, I finally forced myself to get through it on the fourth try. Should Mr. Demetrius decide to write another book, might I suggest hiring a fact checker and an editor? For anyone who would like to read about Llywelyn, stick with Sharon Kay Penman's "Here Be Dragons."
__label__2 Harry Potter not only in the books: This game rocked it was possibly the best game I have ever played. The graphics were unbelivable, and the tasks were even more fun. Even if your not a Harry Potter fan this game is for you. It has the potential to be even bigger if they make a sequal, which I hope they do because the game has left me wanting more.
__label__1 It's OK but not as effective as ones with real kids in it: This DVD is pretty informative about why and how to go potty. But - it drags on and on and I don't think the kids can relate to Elmo as much as the actual kids shown in other poty training DVDs. My son did not even sit through the video while he keeps watching the other one (with real children in it over and over again). I guess it is a matter of preference but it did not work for my son at all.
__label__1 Triple check to make sure: Don't listen to the Amazon make sure it fits dropdown. It isn't acurate. I purchased the part and it didn't fit although Amazon claimed it would. The part itself is fine. Seems like it would be a good product. I actually double checked this part against an online auto part supplier. They agreed with Amazon. Unfortunately they are both wrong and I'm out $23 bucks. Perhaps its Mr. Gasket making the false claim, I don't know. Plus, I'm back to search for a replacement part for my car. Waste of time thanks to someone else's error.
__label__1 No benefits from Smooth: Smooth does not recognize the purchase of their equipment from Amazon, other then (maybe)some warranty stuff. They have training information on using their equipment that they share with their customers who purchase directly from them, as far as they are concerned I am not a customer therefore do not warrant anything from them. This is new equipment purchased from Amazon and not second hand stuff. I will never purchase another piece of equipment from them. Obviously they have no respect for customers.
__label__2 Fabulous: After years of staring at Madame X and other Sargents at the Met and elsewhere, I realized I knew nothing of the people inside the portraits. This book brings the subjects of numerous pictures to life in a new and fascinating way. A must read.
__label__2 if this ain't soul (don't know what is): no, you have not stumbled upon a lost millie jackson or martha & the vandellas album...this is pure nicole willis at her finest. though she's long been grouped with other british vocalists-for-hire, such as shara nelson and carleen anderson, _keep reachin' up_ finds willis stretching her soul/funk wings and taking flight. if i'd not known, going into it, that this were a nicole willis album, i'd have been racking my brain trying to figure out which 70s funkstress to credit for this gem. while the music is 100% old-skool soul, her vocals recall everybody from dionne warwick to adeva, demonstrating the incredible emotional range willis brings to the table. willis howls ("keep reachin' up"), coos ("blues downtown") and wails ("no one's gonna love you") with the best of them, it's just too bad she doesn't get more props, on this side of the pond.
__label__1 pasta: Major choking hazard, incredibly small teeny tiny wooden pastas in a tiny bag, not worth the price, too small, too few, I thought this would be at least the size of penne pasta, but it is more the size of uncooked mac and cheese. Disappointed
__label__1 This was not helpful for me: I personally don't think this book is necessary for anyone familiar with basic weight training exercises or who has basic nutritional knowledge. Jillian is inspiring and knows her stuff. This book was too basic for my needs.
__label__1 Fascinating subject, horrible writing: David Yeadon's book on his experiences in the Outer Hebrides is unfortunately rather dull. The style is bland, riddled with clichés, and the only truly interesting descriptions we get are in the form of quotations. There are some bright spots; his conversations with local residents are intriguing. I only wish that he would have allowed them to speak for themselves; virtually every interchange with the residents is punctuated with David's insipid observations and framed by his own rather portly ego.
__label__2 Double Trouble: These two movies are a good example of 50s SCI-FI at its best. Earth Vs. The spider is good because it adds a bit of 50s Malt Shop Era to the movie. Its seems the spider shots may have been taken from an earlier Sci-FI movie Tarantula.War Of The Colossal Beast is movie #2 in this Twin Cult Classic Set.I remember watching this movie as a kid and still enjoy it. Would recommend this double SCI-FI Collection to all 50s Sci-Fi Addicts.
__label__1 An electronics fan from CT: RETURNED UNIT. NEW ONE WORKS AS ADVERTISED. NOT SURE IF REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS BRAND NEW OR REFURBISHED. UNIT CAME PRE-LOADED WITH NEW SOFTWARE. STILL NOT IMPRESSED WITH GARMIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Don't waste your precious time and money on this unit. I received this for a Christmas gift and was thrilled with the concept. Finally a device that integrated both GPS and Palm applications. Right out of the box I encountered several problems with the unit. It would continuously hard reset itself. I sent an email to Garmin and never received a response. After doing a little research on the web I discovered this is a common problem with this device. I uploaded the new software as recommended and now the unit can not acquire a satellite signal. I then tried to contact Garmin's customer support and have been waiting to talk with someone for over an hour.Bottom line: Don't waste your money. Item was rushed to market without working out the bugs. Also Garmin has no customer support.
__label__2 The book is the scariest one that I've read from R.L. Stine.: This book is "da bomb"!! I've read it so many times because it's one of my favorites. You have to own the entire series so that you know what the whole thing is about, but this one is the best. R.L. Stine is the best author. I would love to see a "Fear Street" book as a movie.
__label__1 Is it ninjutsu?: I have seen the book, but I only saw taijutsu or jujutsu in it. Just martial combat. I did not see ninjutsu per se. Ninjutsu is a composite art and it involves much more than just physical combat. The principles here are good though, but the art refered to in this book is incomplete for not saying it is not shown. So it is an introduction to a regular combat art, like jujutsu, hapkido, etc... It may have some good techniques, but it only covers the aspect of physical combat of ninjutsu, in the author's own understanding.
__label__2 Get this if you're looking for a PCIe soundcard with MIDI: I was a little skeptical at first, since there are multiple reviews that claim incompatibility with Windows 7; once I got it installed, however (on x64), my worries were gone. The card installed smoothly, and comes with a ton of optional software bundled inside. It's worth noting that the included The Waldorf Edition won't install on Windows 7.Included with the drivers is a sound manager/mixer utility with effects built right in. The sound card processes all effects on its own hardware, maintaining the extremely low-latency input/output while outputting from the EMU utility. You can even use it to receive outputs from from or send inputs to ASIO or Windows WAV channels, making the whole process extremely flexible. Send your inputs to ASIO and then use a separate utility like Fruity Loops to record or process the signal, then do whatever you want from there. This card is highly recommended.
__label__1 Two stars at the $16 price!: Horrendously expensive erotica for what it is.I bought The Switch on the recommendation of a friend in my book club, as I like my doms to have moments of submission...especially in romantica. This is sexy for the most part, though it's a bit flabby in the middle and could have been trimmed to make the story slightly more interesting and the sex slightly less repetitive. That said, I bought it for my iPad, and it was INSANELY expensive. $16? What?! There's so much other great switch erotica out there...SO much cheaper and much more romantic! (If it had been 5 dollars, I'd have given it 3.5 stars)Skip this and head right over to Allyson James's Shareem books. They're cheaper and better written, and there are several that have switching` heroes.
__label__2 Excellent Thriller: SAVAGE ART is a clever tale of an ex-FBI profiler, Casey McKinley, who is drawn back into the hunt when the crafty serial killer that scarred her for life resurfaces, this time with children as his target. Danielle Girard does an excellent job of building the story and the characters. This villain made the hair stand up on my neck and had me looking over my shoulder. SAVAGE ART is fast-paced, as the race is on to stop the murders. I missed my bus stop reading this book and give it a high recommendation for those that enjoy intense thrillers. I can't wait for more from Girard.
__label__1 A Loss in the Hyperion Edition: This recording can't possibly compete with Ameling's earlier performance with Dalton Baldwin on Phillips Classics. It totally lacks the luster that Ameling grasped in earlier years. The Hyperion version of her is not among the great gems of the Collection.
__label__2 Great Game: I bought this because it was inexpensive. I was quite suprised to find out how much fun it is. It is simpler than Oblivion and more linear, but it is very entertaining. If you like RPG's I recommend this highly. I beleive Fable 2 is coming out next year. Try this first to get an idea of what to expect with newer graphics and open play.
__label__1 Great price, lousy service.: I've had the stock G2 battery since we bought it and have put many cycles on it. It's still going strong.I've put about 10 cycles on this thing and it won't even hold a charge overnight anymore.Spend the money and get the Canon real thing. Or buy 25 of these things.
__label__1 boring: This is one of the few movies I actually just turned off after about an hour. It's too yawningly predictable and the action is extremely typical and unimaginative. It's just another adrenaline flick with an overly simplistic plot.
__label__2 Very accurate...: I know a lot about certain aspects of Jewish history [and very little about other ones]. I found absolutely no contradiction between what Sachar writes and what I know. This rarely ever happens in books about history.I recommend this book highly to everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike although people with non-European background will probably be overwhelmed and will miss a lots of the finer points. For instance, a typical American has no idea what/where Hungary is, so why should he care that Horthy didn't really want to see all the Jews gassed - some maybe, but not all.A genuine gem.Please note that, contrary to the general perception, not every Jew is filthy rich.
__label__1 Not a good video at all: I am an experienced Spin cyclist and have attended many a spin class by a number of instructors. I beleive this video has been created very poorly. Not only is the content poor, but there is nothing regarding proper form and safety. In several cases, the instructors body position wrong. In addition, the section marking on the video and the ability to jump into a particular segment do not work. I would not recommend this instructor or the company that produced the video.
__label__1 terrible: I orderded paid and never recieved my product. Then after contacting the seller I was ignored and had to file a claim.. avoid using this seller as you probably will not recive the ordre that you have paid for.
__label__1 A Real Disappointment: Amsterdam was my first Ian McEwan novel. Several months ago I glanced at a review and when I saw it in the book store and noted that it had recieved the Booker Award I figured it was worth a read. Being rather cautious, I sat in the book store and read the first 5 pages which I found intriguing. However, it seems that the book went downhill from the moment I left the book store. I don't know what kind of criteria the Booker Committe uses, but I just didn't see this book as worthy of any kind of award. The moral dilemna that were suppose to develope just didn't happen. The story had potential starting out, but the author just didn't develope them. Frankly, this is one that I sure wish I had gotten from the library.
__label__1 Special Edition? Really?: I'm pretty bummed about this version, the special additions to this package do not include any extended scenes, outtakes, or deleted scenes.I don't think the promoters of the Twilight Saga truly understand the fans will buy the movie, on a simple disc with nothing else on it without marking it as Special Edition which insinuates there's something special, or different than the ordinary version?About the movie itself I give the MOVIE 5 *'s I think it's awesome. For those who hate it remember this is HALF the book. So we only got half the story it's a huge cliffhanger all that's missing is the ....to be continued at the end. Don't hate until you see the 2nd half.I'm for sure glad I preordered this at a discount, because had I paid full price I'd have been pretty peeved.
__label__1 Don't Know What People See In It: I picked up The Stone Forest because I like romantic suspense and it looked interesting. It took me about two years to finally read it, and that should have been a red flag. I read a lot of books, and it can take me a while to get to a book. I like to finish anything I've started and try to give books the benefit of the doubt. I've read some pretty bad books and managed to finish them (The Wish Club by Stella Cameron is one - I could not believe that anyone would actually publish it with all the plot holes and cliched writing) However, I just could not get into The Stone Forrest. I made it as far as chapter five before I just peeked at the end to see whodunit. It was not at all surprising. The characters were just flat and did nothing to raise my interest in what happened to them. And the plot bored me. Seriously. I just did not care, and nothing the author did made any difference.Don't bother with this one is my advice.
__label__2 victim in pain: Victim in Pain is the debut album from Agnostic Front. A Classic! The title song is a classic! Hardcore at it's best!
__label__1 Huge diference in size between bottom and top: I bought this suit for a sprint triathlon, but the bottom was so small and the rise so short, there was no way I could wear it. I ended up getting a Tyr 2-piece that was much better
__label__1 Long winded, dialog heavy: A long long meditation on death. If you like to hear professors droning on about their obsession with death, without being particularly witty or profound, read this. Delillo tries so hard to be deeply insightful about the nature of human obsession with death, that his characters just end up sounding stilted, pompous, and frankly, ridiculous. Sure there are some great moments and characters- like Heinrich, or Denise, but none of them gets enough screen time. The Airborne toxic event is squashed into a few rushed chapters, and even though the book isn't trying to be a disaster thriller, there was so much potential in the moments in the barracks, all wasted.
__label__1 Broke on the first use!!: The mechanism on the tray broke the very first time this seat was used by our 2-year-old grandson! Very disappointing!!!
__label__2 Love these dominoes: I bought these dominoes to help my 7 year old daughter with addition and subtraction. We love to play with them and she can easily practice all her single digit addition and subtraction problems.The great thing about these dominoes is that my 3 year old can also play because they are color-coded. How cool is that? He is learning his colors and she is learning her math. A double duty teaching toy.Also, they are a lot of fun just to handle and look at because of the fun colors and the sturdiness of their design. I would definitely buy these again
__label__2 You'll be rolling on the floor...: This book has to be the most original idea for achildren's book that I've ever seen. Hillarious,though probably more so for older "children".A must have for those who love a little bowel humor. :)
__label__2 I'm very happy with my balls: Ernie Balls are nice strings, cheap, durable and produce a rich sound. I'm so proud of my Balls.
__label__2 Without doubt the best Marx Bros. book I've read.: It's rare for a book on a specific subject to be so extremely well-written that it's worth recommending to people on that basis alone. This is a book which would be entertaining and even hilarious to people who aren't Marx Brothers fanatics. Even the classic anecdotes that Marxophiles have read a thousand times are told with such wit and energy that they feel new. Adamson's work has served to greatly enhance my already fanatical interest. And yes, even the footnotes are funny.
__label__2 Renew your sander: A new pad makes the sander hold sanding disks the same way it did when it was new.
__label__1 Worst ever. Dont buy.: I recently bought a new dell xps computer laptop, it had some loose dirt on it so i decided to put this product to use. IT SCREWED UP MY LAPTOP SCREEN! It has streaks everywhere it didnt clean anything the contrary it messed everything up. If the purpuse of this product was to mess up your screen id give it 5 stars. I will also send a formal complaint against this product.
__label__1 BUY BEWARE! 8MTH OLD QUIT WORKING!: I agree this DVD/VCR Combo does NOT deserve even 1 star rating. I purchased this item at Christmas 2003 and now it is dead, I mean DEAD! I too thought the power plug had been disconnected. But after evaluating the system I found that it was correctly pluged in and up untill today it was working fine. Now I have NO power. Not even a link light. I see a VHS tape is stuck in the player as well. Buy beware. I wish I would have read these review befor I wasted my hard earned money. Pesonally I thing Sylvania should have a recall on this item, and Sear,Robuck should remove it from there shelves.
__label__2 Vampire Vixens From Venus: Adult Sci-Fi that captures the 80's style of film with low budget acting. Still a fun movie for those who like campy adult films with humor & Special effects plus sexy women.
__label__2 Awesome!! And you can see out it: This is by far the best eye patch I have ever seen!!! It has a bungee like cord with multiple links on the back to adjust how tight you need it, which makes it extremely comfortable. I got a lot of complements every time I wore it, and I'm sure I'll get more in the future. The best feature of this is I can still see out of the eye patch, it has a tinted/smokey colored lens under the skull and cross bones so you don't lose your depth perception, and no the skull and cross bones don't interfere with your line of sight as much as you think it would. I let several people wear it and they were amazed. Its like wearing sunglasses that just covers one eye. ha ha. I thought at first this was a bit expensive, but really its well worth the price due to how well it really works, and doesn't hinder your vision.
__label__2 Classic Reborn: In this latest edition of Diddy Kong Racing for the DS you have all that was before and more....This is a great classic to bring to the DS. If you played the original then you are familar with the controls(which havent changed to much) and the courses. This version has updated in that you will be using the stylus alot from everything like getting a power boost start to collecting balloons to get to the boss races. Some major and I think great improvements in the game are the track editor(unlocked later in game) and of course WI FI play. There are also alot of other new extras that you will just have to play to find out. All in all this is a great game for any hardcore fans of the original and hardcore racers. The only downfall I thought with the game is that I wish the graphics could have been a little sharper. Other than that it is an excellent game and recommend highly in gaming library.
__label__1 Ok for health food: This cookies tastes ok for a healthy snack, but don't bother if you're looking for a good cookie in general. At 300-ish calories, this cookie is pretty caloric. However, you get a very good serving of fiber and protein along with it. I personally wouldn't buy this variety again. I way prefer the taste and texture of the double chocolate chunk variety from the same maker.
__label__1 Everything sticks to this "non-stick" skillet: See title. The folding handle is nice, the size is convenient, and the extra handle is a good feature, but all the extras in the world don't make a pan advertised as non-stick fulfill its most basic function. It's also too thin to spread heat properly - the middle gets hot much faster than the rest, and if you're cooking something you can't stir (like fried eggs), food in the center burns (and sticks) while the edges stay raw. I'm very disappointed and will have to replace this skillet soon, which is sad and needlessly expensive.
__label__2 Wowee . . .: It's a little hard to use for those of us with small hands, but other than that, it works like a charm. It's a very long blade, which is perfect for larger, round breads.
__label__2 The movie is better: Overall, the writing is bad. For a teenage prodigy, Charlie writes like an a 8 year old, and given that it's a book, it should've gone in more detail about some of the more serious topics in the book. The movie by far was more earnest and warmer than the book, but its still a great read.
__label__1 catchy only goes so far: Many of the tracks have a great dance line to them, but beyond that ( which too gets repetitive ) the lyrics are incredibly loose, the content of the tracks is greatly lacking, and they depend too much on the voice synth to mask the obvious lack of lyrical attention. Still, a few of the tracks are high-energy and in spite of their difficulties, make for some enjoyable music.
__label__1 Where is the rest?: When I heard that 'Drug Wars' was being released on DVD, I was pleased. It is, in fact, one of the best American TV miniseries' ever made. However, this disc is not 'Drug Wars', but is rather a crude approximation of it. They took the 280 minute feature and edited it into a 130 minute trailer. All narrative depth is gone, and character development is non-existent. Also, it seems to have been re-edited so randomly that the plot ceases to make sense at several points. The reissue of this film was pointless, because it is not 'Drug Wars.' Why even bother releasing the film if you are going to deliberately sabotage it?
__label__1 Too bad...not too good.: I saw this singer, Rashida Jolley, on America's Got Talent a few years ago. I thought she was great, singing while acompanying herself on harp. She sang the Roberta Flack number, "Killing Me Softly". I though her performance was just fantastic...so much so that I got in touch with her and asked if she had recorded anything...she said "Yes" and I bought this CD. Unfortunately, "Killing Me Softly" is not on this CD and the "originals" that are on it are mediocre...to be charitable.
__label__1 Too much!: This book could have been useable and interesting, but as a well turned out cook myself. these recipes were too much. The etherial and gourmet spiritual pomposity really turned me away. For example, he gives a butter sauce recipe of sorts, but never really spells it out. The rabbit passage was the final straw. For this chef to consider himself a "god" ! of food, rabbit spirits, etc... thanks for reminding me to stay vegetarian. How totally unappetizing!! I burned the book I was so mad.
__label__2 Easy Healthier Popcorn: This is a great air popper. I agree with other reviewers - you have to be careful as hot kernels do jump out at the beginning and end of popping.It is smaller than previous poppers I've had which is nice. So far it's popped quickly and evenly. I highly recommend it, especially as an alternative to microwave popcorn which can have lots of fat and preservatives.
__label__2 CG meets Let There Be Drums: If you love computer graphics and percussion, then ANIMUSIC 2 is the DVD for you. For 40 minutes Wayne Lytle, Composer/Producer/Director, treats your eyes and ears to a modern CG concert. Not only are the graphics eye-popping, they are consistant throughout each piece. The robots/instruments use the same key/horn/item to produce each sound. It's no wonder that each piece took about 4 months to produce. My favorite compositions are Pipe Dream 2 and Gyro Drums. The other 6 are also great eye/ear candy. A variety of audio formats, screen aspects, and special features are especially appreciated.
__label__1 Very Poorly Written: I'm so glad that I didn't pay the price that the college bookstore was asking. This is a typical Health Information Technology textbook, poorly written, dull, and unedited.
__label__1 what a waste of time: not even close to the standards set by the first of the Anita Blake series. A one-trick pony of a plot, lots of gore for no reason and shallow character development. It started in the middle of a story, never went anywhere, and didn't do much on the way. Dull, depressing and not entertaining.
__label__2 It was great: I love it it made my car sound absolutely amazing no distrotion and I can turn it up really really really loud.
__label__1 RCA RS1283 [stinks]: I purchased this unit around Christmas of last year. It broke after a little more than 4 months and has been in the shop ever since. When I contacted RCA about the problem they gave me the name of a local repair shop. When I contacted them they let me know they didn't even service RCA audio products. After a couple more inferiorating phone calls to the RCA service center , which does not have a toll free number, I finally got the name of a local repair shop. I am still waiting to see if RCA will replace the unit. I wish I had never purchased this unit and would not recommend that anyone else purchase it either. I would give it no stars if that were an option.
__label__1 NOT Paul Schwartz: I bought this cd because according to the info from [store name], the composer of the CD was Paul Schwartz. HE ISN'T!! I thought it was going to be similar to the two ARIA CD's that I have that were more electronic and operatic music. This was hard rock music and the composer was a guy named Paul Genet!! So [company name] has it wrong! It is not the same composer.
__label__2 Love the diet plan! Fast and easy calorie counter!: Fast and easy calorie counter. Extensive database on the internet for those of us watching carbohydrates, (carbs), protien, fat, and fiber. I love the diet,exercise, fitness plan. It is so easy, I am sure I attain my perfect weight using this plan with very little effort, and I am well on my way! It is also not an expensive diet plan with lot's of prepackaged food at outrageous prices. You can eat the foods you love, and make a few minor modifications. Buy this book if you want to get slim forever!
__label__1 check the cd case before opening: Christmas surprise. Gave this item as a gift imagine the surprise to open the case to find no cd or even the black cd holder wasn't inside. So check your before opening. Not even sure I'll bother to return it, it's a defect but try to prove that one, once it's opened. So all I'd get is a 50% refund. Hopefully amazon reads there reveiws & I'm not the only one this has happen to.
__label__2 Carpet Shield: THis stuff is fantastic. I use the Surface Shields CS2450W Carpet Shield, 24-Inch by 50-Feet for the high traffic area that my dogs use to prevent mud, dirt and debris from being tracked into my home. It usually last 45 or so days before having to replace. Highly recommended for dog families. Saves on vacuum and steam cleaning and is super inexpensive. Constantly receive compliments for how it looks and the protection it provides. Way to go surface shields you made a solid quality product that i will continue to order and use.
__label__2 One of the best Toys you can ever buy!!: My kids got this as a gift & they cannot put it down. The only problem is they fight over it, I need to buy another one to keep the peace. Great toy at great price !!!!!
__label__1 seems good but flawed: I was going to buy this seat. I thought the padding was good. It seemed pretty comfortable, and it fit my daughter well. While trying it my only issue was that the tabs that you buckle fall through the hole to underneath the seat. So if they end up falling through the holes you would have to unbuckle the whole seat and start over, where some of the other have plastic inserts (graco&cosco do this)to prevent this problem. I was very disappointed because the price point was good and it seemed like a good car seat.
__label__1 Did you realize.......?: Did you realize that nearly all the reveiwers are girls? Yeah, that's right. Am I the only girl who actually know what real music is? All this c.d. is about is what you can see on MTV every day. (Not trying to diss MTV, it rocks! ) Girls are screaming over some guy who is lip syncing at a concert. You can make up the lyrics or melodies to "Can I get Your Number" any time, and i'll bet any mony that their producers wrote these songs? *sigh* What happened to 1994? When punk and heavy metal ruled the world? Whatever. My opinon won't be heard over the voices of screaming girls.
__label__1 ARRIVED: RECEIVED IT.Great amount of paper for the price.I think I haven't had to buy more in quite literally ages.
__label__2 Highly recommended, essential reading.: James Doherty's In The Beginnings: Foundations For The Millennium Ahead addresses the basic values of family, work, community, peace, freedom, and faith that are the cornerstone of our society and the only guides that will serve us well in the millennium ahead. Doherty writes of elements essential to the health and well being of the nation, from the daily life of our local neighborhood to the international challenges that face our nation as a whole. In The Beginnings is highly recommended, essential reading for anyone with an interest in continuing American personal, political, and economic freedoms into the future for themselves, their children, and their children's children.
__label__2 Exactly what I needed!: I have always loved this series and I misplaced Round 5. This DVD was exactly what I needed to complete my collection again :)
__label__2 Say goodbye to laptop leg!: I play games on my laptop, and thus my laptop can produce a LOT of heat from the side exhausts. As a result, I've got a perma burn on my leg. I knew I needed to do something, so I ordered one of these. It was a lightning deal, and for the price, it was worth a shot. I've had it for about three weeks, and I'm proud to say that my leg burns are healing nicely, where as they were getting reburnt everyday before. The laptop itself fits nicely on either side (I have a 16") and doesn't slip too much. I use this both in bed and sitting normally (although I usually do have my feet up).Now, I will note that my laptop has SIDE exhausts - not bottom exhaust. My laptop is nice and cool while using this thing, but those with laptops that blow air from the bottom may not have the same results - so use this with caution.
__label__2 From one intercontinental to another....: Being both an intercontinental myself and a Bill Frisell lover, I was naturally pleased when this was released. But little did I know how absolutely magical it would be. Vinicious Cantuaria and Jenny Shineman make this album for me, they, like Frisell and everyone on this album, are the type of Artists the world needs more of. Intercontinental, unpredictable, modest, and beautiful.
__label__1 Same charger connector cannot fit all LG phones: LG phones have 3+ types of connectors, so this vehicle power charger cannot fit all models. I am writing this review to spare Amazon and fellow shoppers the pain of returning this item.WalMart sells 3 types of LG chargers for $9.74 online and in stores, and I love their helpful packages. They list the models supported and extend the connectors outside, so we may try to plug the connectors in our phones before we buy or open the packages.
__label__1 Great Beginning But the Rest Is Never Ending.: I have read many of the customer reviews and they seemed to be split. I unfortunately agree with the negative reviews. The first segment of the book is wonderful. Without giving away any plot the train ride and the scenes in LA are riveting. If the book had ended there I would have given it a 5 star.The remaining portion of the epic is not convincing, wordy and boring at times. I continued to read this portion because of the momentum of the first portion. Also it was interesting to try to figure out exactly what was happening. This was resolved mid way through the second portion. From about 450 onwards the story dragged. I found the end unsatisfying.The question that is touched on better never really explored is the moral dilema that was faced. In the 700 pages more should have spent on this issue and less driving in a never ending snow storm.
__label__1 Does Not Play MP3 CD's - Piece of Junk: I purchased this alarm clock, hoping for it to play my mp3 cd's. It said on the spec sheet at Best Buy that it did, and it also said online on the review that it plays mp3 cd's. Well, I got it home, plugged it in, it lit up the clock the clock switched between about 5 different colors and I thought, wow, that's neat. Then I proceeded to put in my mp3 cd. I pressed play, the cd spun, and then it said NO SONG. It would not play it. Then the alarm clock shut down. It won't even let me eject my cd! It won't even show the time or do anything! It only lasted 2 minutes! I am taking it back, I was baffled at how quickly it broke. Hopefully when I take it back they will bust it open and get my cd out.
__label__1 Not Great for Hardwood Floors.: I first have to say how much I LOVE my Dyson vacuum. I was looking for a vacuum to sweep my hard wood floors better and could reach under furniture. This is awkward to use and it either pushes the dirt around or sucks to the floor so you have to bend down to lift just a little to get the right power. I would not recommend this, the bare floor setting for the vacuum cleaner works just fine. I am still on the hunt for a light weight sweeper that is great.
__label__1 Can be useful, if you have a basic understanding of Korean: This book has many errors in it.The pronunciation for some of the letters are wrong.("aw" is shown as "o", for example)And even the definition of some of the words are wrong.(the book shows the word "nan-lo" means "stove", but, really means "heater")Don't use this book to learn how to read and write Hangul.It can be helpful to learn vocabulary, as long as you have a friend who knows Korean to make sure you are learning the words correctly.
__label__2 The best buy!: This is probably the best buy you can find anywhere. For the price, this particular webcam is a steal. It comes with a bundle of software for video editing, snapshots, and several other softwares conveniently stored on two CD's. This could also turnout as a great gift for those loved ones who are far away from you. The resolution was amazing and it works wonders for single people looking for online webcam chats! Since I bought this product five of my friends have followed my example. Highly recommended!
__label__2 Loved MLM when I was 8-12 years old: and still do. Would love a complete set of same. Basically it was the I Love Lucy Show with Father/Daughter instead of Husband/Wife with the addition of a pathetic boyfriend for Margie
__label__1 Not even one star: Terrible. Dialogue was constantly mumbled. The plot made no sense, and characters that were introduced were just forgotten about.If you like this movie, you have no taste, and little self-respect.If you complain, "Hey, it's just one of those movies to trip out on."Then you haven't seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
__label__2 Privileged Information: Hard to find book at the library. I was pleased to be able to get it so fast from you. One of Stephen Whites' better books!
__label__2 So many remixes.... I love it still.: I love Whitney Houston. When she passed away, my mom was depressed so I ordered this CD for her. She loved it. But I really like the Cool Down & Throw Down part. I wish that the Throw Down didn't have remixes, I only wish it had her up-tempo songs instead (like "I Wanna Dance With Somebody","How Will I Know",etc) But other than that it's an incredible CD.
__label__2 A1 Series: It's such a treat to watch a tv program with great writing, acting, sets and costumes. Having lived through the 60's , I remember how it was and this show captures it perfectly. If you have not seen it yet, I suggest starting at the beginning, if only to see the progression of the characters and the big change in society as it moves along into the late 60's.
__label__1 WHO KNEW CHRISTMAS COULD BE THIS DEPRESSING!: With a cast this good, its amazing that this film is so bad! The first two thirds of the film are so depressing that I almost couldn't imagine watching this in the holiday season. Of course the ending is predicatable and uplifting, but the journey there is rather dull. It's just too little, too late.The film is over loaded with special effects and not much else. It's not dark enough to be a black comedy and it's not sentimental enough to give you that classic holiday feeling. HO HO Hummmmmm!
__label__2 Will make you cry!: Beware! This movie is a TEARJERKER! (even for men!) The struggle the main character has to go through with the sudden change of her husband is astonishing, compelling, and full of a fire to live and escape. Not for younger kids, too high of an emotional scale. A great picture of how life has been (and still is) for these kinds of people.
__label__2 Think about forgiveness: This movie is a story about Christian faith, loss, and what race really means in America. It tells the true story of an event that changed lives through tragedy and forgiveness.A small Texas town home to both blacks & whites suffers a accident that crosses racial lines. But instead of the devision and hate we get sold in the media, the Heart of Texas that knows no color stands tall.The presentation is very good, though you can see it is not Hollywood quality. Take the time to watch the extras on the DVD for additional blessings.This movie made me reconsider forgiveness in my own life, and in my children's lives. It reminded me of the sacrifice Christ made for me and my faith. While watching, women will weep, but I smiled with joy.An uplifting tale for the whole family.
__label__1 i respect Reeve but....: this movie just can't be made. No one will ever be able to remake a classic....and especially a Hitchcock one for that matter.
__label__2 WHATS WRONG WITH THE ALBUM ART?????: This album is pretty good - not quite classic status but as usual Pettidee delivers quality crunkness. My personal favs are "Glide Aside", "Dont Stop", "Never Give up" and "Huh Man". The album is definately worth checkin out- the beats, positive message, dirty south style, pettidee's voice, and the ALBUM COVER, all make for a really good record.Another one to check out by Pettidee is "Resurrections." I copped that off iTunes which i think is the only place you can get it. Got a harder sound than this album but its dope!
__label__1 It was more like a year in the life of Amy: It appears that Amy had a difficult year when the family moved. She had many more issues than her father womanizing, gambling and drinking. Her red hair was a problem for her. The author told a good story on how Amy coped in her child hood, but how did she get beyond that point in her life. When the book ended she still was struggling with unresolved issues.
__label__1 Huge disappointment: Ok, this is written from a modelers standpoint.The big problem is 90% of the pics are flight pics. very few on the ground so as far as getting detail walk around shots for modeling? FORGET it! no useful pics of the landing gear, no line drawings of the cockpit beyong the front panel, no shots of the wheels, no close ups of panel and rivit detail, no usable closeups of engine nozzles. 6 pics I had immediately recognized and had downloaded from the internet, there 2 poorly done pics of pilot/with suit. and the helmets were only lightly addressed. If you want page after page after page of pretty plane in flight shots, then you will like this book. it does do a good textural historical overview of development of the type though.I bought the book brand new and subsequently saw it available used for 6 dollars. BUMMER! in fact, i have other aerofax titles, and they are VERY useful, dont know what happened with this particular book.
__label__2 Four years and counting with almost daily use: I have had this knife for four years and it has yet to fail me. When I first got the knife, I was VERY careful with it so as to prevent it from being scratched - since then I realized something - IT'S A POCKET KNIFE! USE IT LIKE ONE! I can and have used it for almost anything. The features I use most often in order are: the scissor, screwdriver (with a magnetic tip), pen, tweezers and knife. I have at one time or another used EVERY feature for its intended use or otherwise and LOVE this little knife. Its size also makes it really easy to keep around - in a pocket, on a belt (with the little leather case - not included), etc.... I take it everywhere I go and am always saddened when I have to leave it at home when flying. This knife is of the smaller of the two sizes Victorinox makes but includes the most and best features within this category. This is one of the best investments one can make.
__label__2 Handy to have: I bought this compressor to do small jobs like fill tires and clean parts. It does take a while to build up initial pressure. It does what I need.
__label__2 WHO IS JOHN CASE?: Whoever he may be, he ranks with Michel Creighton and Robin Cook. His mixture of fact with fiction gives his story both suspense and credibility. There really was an expedition to Norway to hunt for the virus. The 1918 flu was pandemic. My 90 year old grandmother lived through it and to her flu equals death. She would no sooner take a flu vaccine then I would an AIDS vaccine. Anyone who has worried about biological terroism should read this book. Lets just hope Saddam Hussain doesn't get hold of the copy. As for those who compain about this not being a "thriller" they must be addicted to gun battles and car chases. This is a psychological thriller based on the very real capabilities of anthrax brewing terrorists. If you want blood, gore and ridiculous story lines go back to Dean Koontz.
__label__1 Never Worked: I was never able to install this product. I had previously installed the trial version of this same product. Eventhough I uninstalled the trial version before attempting to install the non-trial version, after I installed the non-trial version, I kept getting the message that the trial period had expired. It seemed that I was still running the trial version eventhough I had removed it. Since it was a download version, I never received the activation code because it was supposed to be integrated in the program files. Therefore, I was never able to activate the product.Symantec support is not adequate at all. Though I found information on how to completely uninstall the product in www.symantec.com, after following the instructions and reinstalling the product, the trial version came up AGAIN. I wrote to symantec and after two weeks got a reply which directed me to the page I had already found.I finally gave up and decided to return the product.
__label__1 Terrible stench!: So I have had this for over a year now... and it still stinks! Not to mention that the type of rubber is very sticky.... and will pick up any bit of lint.Save your money and try something else...
__label__1 Sorry film and Gorry film: hate to say it but it is one the most boring horror movies i have ever seen i dont know why but it nearly put me to sleep i only would say buy this movie if ur into cheezy 80's horror flicks....which normaly I am, but not the case with this film but in its defense i will say the kill secnes were bloody and no bad for when it was made which is why it got two stars instead of one.
__label__2 I WANT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I realy like this doll. she is cool. Her hair looks GREAT and she DEFINATLY looks durable... AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUSSSSSSOOOOOOMMMMMMMEEEEEEE
__label__2 Great for the price!: To be able to print very good photos, scan documents easily, and get sharply printed documents from ink jets (in color no less) for under a hundred bucks is amazing to me. My machine operates flawlessly. Con: Ink runs out rather quickly especially in color, so pick your must color docs wisely. Cartridges aren't cheap.
__label__1 A cable built for a PS2 that barely fits in the PS2: It's a cable, a rather cheap cable. The connector barely fits into the system..I had to jam it, and thought I snapped a connector on the PS2. Once the cable is in, it starts to slide out because of the ill-fit. I do not recommend this product, it is junk. I would have rated it 0, but cannot. I can see why this was 4 dollars.
__label__2 Solid Cable: Good quality cable at an awesome price. Don't spend crazy amounts of money on "name brand" cables. This is a well built cable with good solid connectors. The beauty of digital is that the signal gets there or it doesn't, no need for crazy amounts of shielding or other gimmicks the $$$ cable at the big box store has.
__label__2 Great book!: This book is a great way to show someone you care about them when they have lost a dog. I have given copies of this book numerous times.
__label__2 Theeis Movie is a High-Five!: This movie had me in stitches in the theaters, it stil has me in stitches watching it at home. The deleted scenes were the best part of the DVD for me. Borat has always been my favorite "Ali G. Show" character. I hope Sacha comes out with another even funnier Borat movie!
__label__1 Don't buy: I purchased the original router in September 2009. In March 2010 it failed and Cisco replaced it, now in August 2010 the replacement is failing with the same symptoms as the first router. I've spent enough time on the phone and online troubleshooting this product. After being a Linksys customer for years its time to move on to another company.
__label__1 Had this been his first song, it wouldn't be on the airwaves: This song is a musical sappy mess. Of course we love "Livin La Vida Loca", but if Ricky sang the Sesame Street song for his next release, it would sell. Why? Because people are sheep! I've known a couple of artists trying to break into the industry with great lyrics, music and powerfully versatile voices, and their demos are returned unopened. Some of their songs were 10 times better than "She's All I Need". So Ricky, keep shakin it and keep it snappy cause this attempt is pathetic.
__label__1 YOU CALL THIS MUSIC !: It is sad to think you can steal someone elses music and distroy it in such an awful way! Leave well enough alone!(like we need a hip hop drum machine version of Eurythmics"Sweet Dreams")
__label__1 Family Stone: Where else except in a movie is a girlfriend going to go out with her boyfriends brother and the boyfriend falls in love with her sister...I can't believe he had actually purchased an engagement ring and ended up marrying the sister and the girlfriend married the brother! Where are the morals?
__label__2 Excellent comprehensive account of nutrition for pregnancy: Very sound and accurate account of nutrition for pregnancy. Very concise and thorough in their discussion of each nutrient needed for pregnancy. Excellent discussion of special nutritional needs for vegetarians and diabetics. I would recommend this book to all my pregnant clients.
__label__1 Poor for users of hearing aids: This phone advertises that it is good for people with mild hearing loss. I hoped it would be good for someone wearing behind the ear hearing aids. Not so. I could not get the telecoil in my hearing aids to sync with the phone. And even with the volume set at maximum, I could not hear the voice at the other end of the line. I returned the phone and replaced it with Panasonic KX-TG9332 which is also DECT 6.0. It is not especially recommended for the hearing impaired but I am able to use the telecoil on my hearing aids with the phone and the voice on the other end is clear. Also, the manual for the Panasonic is well written which is not the case for the GE.Reviews for phones seldom mention hearing aid users. I hope this will be helpful for those with hearing aids.
__label__1 No where near as good as the first Ghostbusters: I don't understand! where did Ivan Rightman go wrong! Ghostbusters an awsome film it was good at the ending of the first! It didn't deserve a sequal easpeacially as dumb and boring one like this pppppppfffffffffff pethetic! And Slimer my favorite ghost looks nothing like he does in the first. Well you should see it anyway if you liked the first. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!! I guess. Also see this film Ghostbusters
__label__2 great read: Would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. Great read. Fun, entertaining, light hearted. Great series about a lawyer and Congress.
__label__1 What a waste of money!: !Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzle, S2220I had one of these several years ago and it worked fine, but eventually quit working. I bought another one to replace it and used it three times and it quit working. What a waste of money!
__label__1 Robert Jordan's Winning Streak Ends With #7: Robert Jordan, one of today's best fantasy writers, has lost his first battle with his recent release of "The Path of Daggers". This current book lacks any of the colorful story telling of the previous seven books. The fact that he does not even include Matt should clue you into the incompleteness of this book.Lets just hope that he will try and make up for this poor effort in the next book.
__label__1 Much shorter than original mobile arm!: I was excited to find a "universal" mobile arm, since my regular arm couldn't be attached easily to the cosleeper we use. I was surprised when I tried it today that it is MUCH shorter than the original mobile arm by a good 5 inches. The mobile would be within reach of the baby using this arm! I've already positioned the crib mattress on the highest setting for our newborn, and lowering it would solve the closeness issue, but I don't think I will do that at this point. Also, when I tried the clip on our cosleeper, it didn't hold tight enough, and leaned in quite a bit.
__label__1 What the heck did you ship me????: I really do like the Naturalizer Mae Loafers and would like to get my hands on a few more pairs....but this seller sold me the totally wrong shoe...some really big zebra-like high heel. Not sure what happened to the shoe I ordered. I immediately returned the product.
__label__2 A well written book: I really liked this book. It has a bunch of easy to follow, and easy to make, recipes that serve 6, which is good for my large family. I recommend it to anyone who has a busy life and a family to take care of.
__label__2 So true: After eighteen years of being stereotyped as "the book worm," it's good to know that there's others out there like me. I agree wholeheartedly with Quindlen about the effect of books on life and on many of her other points. Her small book is simple but true. I can't wait to explore some of the books on her reading lists that I've not yet read. I recommend this to all of the other bookworms in the world: you are not alone, and at least one person understands you.
__label__1 So what is it?: There is no description for this magazine. Before now, I couldn't say that I had heard of it. Now, after clicking on the link and seeing there was no description... I can safely say that I STILL have not heard of it. So what is it?
__label__2 great product: i really enjoy this product. it gives you a great upper body workout. the only drawback is that the workout dvd is sold seperately, it should be included in the package.
__label__2 Monday Mourning: This is the 7th Temperance Brennan novel written by Kathy Reichs, who like the fictional Temperance is a forensic anthropologist, dividing her time between North Carolina and Quebec. Both of these settings are great, but Montreal is especially appealing and Reichs descriptions of the old streets and neighborhoods of Montreal are very well done. Temperence deals with three skeletons found buried beneath a pizza parlor in Montreal, a friend's personal crisis, and her own romantic difficulties. This book really moves along and captures the reader. This is the best of the series so far.
__label__2 Excellent read...: I enjoyed this novel VERY MUCH. Mr Bahr writes with such insight that I felt I was there, and it was such a revelation to me. It goes way past the known facts into the lives and feelings of everyday existence of the people at that time. Read it and prepare to live a slice of the real Civil War.
__label__2 a good game: I love the graphics and the game. I own most of the command and conquer games. The game is actually a resource hog. I have an amd duron 1300 with nvidia 64mb graphics card and 768 mb pc133 ram.The game slows down with the more computers you play against.I love the special weapons that you aquire through experience. A definite game to get. gave 4 stars due to the slow down.
__label__1 Nice idea, not functional: Very simply. I am a contractor that does a lot of technical installations. This would have been a great help, had it been accurate. Unfortunately it is not. They should have left the level vials off of it, because they are completely inaccurate. Unless you just need a low profile aluminum ruler, and don't mind paying for functionality that does not work, stay away from this product. We have gone back to our 10 year old plastic empire ruler/level, because at least it is accurate.
__label__2 " ..three things that's for sure: taxes, death and trouble": This line, of course, comes from the title track from this underated soundtrack album by Marvin Gaye. One of the most autobiographical songs he recorded, it also feature great sax work by Trevor Lawrence. The rest of the album is good too, featuring some great instrumentals ("T" Plays it Cool," the main theme). Definitely worth picking up.
__label__1 The Golden Ratio: Not being inclined towards number mysticism, I found the book fuzzy and sluggish. Whether the golden ratio was or wasn't used in human construction or composition doesn't interest me, because I find no mystical meaning arising out of such use (much of the book is about how claims of its use are in fact wrong). The discovery of this ratio in nature, on the other hand, is interesting because the question arises of why it's occurring there. But the book isn't structured tightly and the author's meandering, even when ostensibly concerned with the golden ratio in mathematics or nature, frustrated my attention. It took me quite a while to finish it because it didn't hold my interest. Livio's final chapter on whether or not God is a mathematician doesn't bode well for his book on that subject.
__label__2 A Fount of Information: This is a very informative book for those who want plain language information on attracting hummingbirds and butterflies. The author explains things, step by step, and shows pictures to help your understanding. All of the Ortho books are written in a clear, comprehensible manner. A definite buy for your library!
__label__2 Still a classic: We've been very pleased with Jenga. It's a lot of fun and the kids enjoy playing it.The only reason I gave it four stars is that the stacking tool that helps you to quickly set up Jenga was made out of cardboard. The older sets had one that was made out of rigid plastic. It got ruined the first day and ended up in the recycling bin. This had made Jenga slower to set up.
__label__2 A enjoyable read.: An enjoyable read with likeable cops investigating some less than pleasant characters. About half way through the book I thought the suspect was rather obvious but as the end approached the plot twists became fast and furious. The background of stamp collecting adds a nice bit of atmosphere. Recommended.
__label__1 Disappointed with freshness: These candy bars were not very fresh. Of course they are Wunderbars and still taste pretty good! They end up costing quite a bit which would be fine if they were fresh!
__label__1 Very disappointing: Whenever an author spends half his words telling you what he's going to tell you later, you know he doesn't have much to tell you. I saw a new update is out on this one and perhaps it's been improved but I think most people would be best served reading product descriptions and reviews in the Apple App Store.
__label__1 Typo Alert: Somehow the mousepad would have more credibility for me if they knew how to correctly spell the word greater in the product description. What has happened to our society is utterly shameful.
__label__1 Dreadful: This movie is absolutely dreadful. From the story, to the cast and and on to the acting, it was all bad.
__label__2 C.E. Smith Helm Chair Cover - Soft White Vinyl w/Vents: C.E. Smith Helm Chair Cover - Soft White Vinyl w/VentsThe product met the deascription perfectly, was priced right and was shipped on time. They are perfect for keeping the new seat cushions we purchased free from the elements and should help them last a few years longer.
__label__2 Excellent: This is an excellent recording of the Bartok quartets. This music requires careful and repeated listening to really appreciate the structure of Bartok's achievement. The effort is quite worthwhile. Common criticism of this recording is that the Emerson isn't 'rough' enough, presumably meaning even and relatively conventional tempi and intonation. These performances, however, are the work of musicians who aim at being a vehicle of the music rather than drawing attention to themselves. For someone like me, who is listening to these pieces for the first time, this is probably a particularly good introduction to the Bartok quartets. There are other highly praised recent recordings and differentiating among them is a matter of taste.
__label__2 Delicious: First, I will say: I eat a lot of salads and fruit, and not much processed food, so I have unusually biased tastes. That being said, these remind me of brownies. Perfect for a sweet tooth, and surprisingly filling for how small they are. I love them, but gave a friend (with an average american diet) one to try. At first she was skeptical, but then said it just tasted like chocolate.
__label__1 Rancid Cream: How to distroy a classic album:1)Get trendy, over boomy, monotonous rhythm track2)Slap onto classic album, mix to front, push classic track somewhere in the distant back and randomly intersperse3)Rent girl, buy can of shaving cream for cover.
__label__2 A VERY good book: I am a young adult, and am truly grateful for this book. I have a strong belief in Jesus and the Christian faith, however it was based almost soley on faith. The author brought solid proof that Jesus truly walked on this earth, did what the bible says he did, and was not just an over-rated man that Christians base their belief on. A great book for those who are trying to understand their faith, and I have heard great reviews by people with a lot of knowledge in this area as well.
__label__2 An Effortless Read: Great book, it is not often that an author can come up with such a comprehensive book as this on his first try. This had it all, a great story, good characters, wonderful action and a quick pace. This is an exciting book. It really made me happy reading the book; it was like a great game of treasure hunt where you find everything. Each time I was ready for a plot twist, action of drama it was there. The characters just explode in your memory - you do not get them out of your head. Overall great effort.
__label__2 Great resource for all filmmakers: This is a classic that every filmmaker should read. "Shaking the Money Tree" de-mystifies the biggest challenge every filmmaker faces--fundraising. It identifies various funding sources, how to ask and when to ask. More importantly, it gets behind the minds and motivations of individual funders, foundations, and other sources, so the filmmaker is better prepared meet their needs.
__label__1 Not what I wanted: The ease of the internet got me as I was in a hurry and clicked too soon. I was looking for the actual book published several years ago. Instead, I purchased a book, based on a movie, which was based on a dang book. Who needs that?
__label__1 Only paid $1 for this at Once Upon A Child and that was too much: Visited Once Upon A Child today and they wanted $13 used for this mat however it just was clearanced to $1 today so I bought it for my 7 year old girl. I have to say $1 was too much to pay for this mat. I can't imagine if I had paid $49.99 for it how I would have felt. She was so excited, however once home and she started "trying" to do the cheer moves she became annoyed at it because it went so fast and by the time she saw the light on the board and looked down to see where to step it was on another step. Now it will go into the toy box until who knows when.
__label__1 A Different Approach: I agree the newer vinyl tubes are a pain to roll up because they unwind quickly but there's a quick fix for that making this gadget unnecessary. After you roll up the tube, use a clothespin, paper bag clip or similar clip and attach it to the end of the rolled up tube keeping it from unfolding.
__label__2 Song of Songs: Enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the authors first book Roses Have Thorns..Enjoy the period and the story being told.
__label__2 Bridge for Dummies: I first rented this book from my local library and after renewing it for the maximum number of times decided I needed to "own" it. I find it to be a great reference book.
__label__2 Great Space Saver: This little Sanyo is a true space saver and we have used it every day - love it. Just what I've looked for many years! My space for a toaster is tall and skinny and I finally found a toaster that matches my space and it does a great job on bagels, toast, & pizza, which is our main use for a toaster. Great product - hard to believe they discontinued this great product. I wanted to get another one for a friend and found it was discontinued.
__label__2 I am addicted!: I know that this book was supposed to be for my daughter, but I am usually the one who giggles the most at 'bee-boo' and other cute parts of the book.
__label__2 excellent game for price: this is a good game in fact both are! I got mine on e-bay for 20$for both. Just buy both and it will keep you distracted from therest of this annoying world for a time.
__label__1 To many suds: We have soft water in our area and the dishwasher kept overflowing with suds from the Earth Friendly dishwasher gel, cut way back on the amount we put in and it still overflowed.I read about the different ways to cut back on suds, from using vinegar to cooking oil, but thought it was ridicules to have do this every time I wash dishes in the dishwasher.We have since switched over to Ecover dishwasher tablets and problem solved, and the dishes come out sparkling, clean & spotless.
__label__2 Some funny stuff: I really enjoyed this dvd. It's not for everyone. If you have a broad sense of humor you should enjoy it. I've never seen this guy perform on stage before this, but I thought it was really funny. Good stuff.
__label__2 Easy to mount and very well built: The product is very easy to install and very well built... The instructions are easy and everything you need to install it is right there in the box...
__label__1 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: How could such a potentially fascinating person have such a boring biography? No, I didn't read it through - I COULDN'T. I simply went to the index, looked up things that seemed interesting, and read those sections.Otherwise, the book is mostly a tedious bore and a major disappointment. It's easy to understand why it wasn't a runaway bestseller.
__label__1 disapointed: product was as discribed, except for the soiled spot. Im glad I was able to get it out. When I purchase clothing over the internet I dont expect them to arrive needing to be laundered.
__label__2 I would give this 6 stars if I could: It's a combination of two albums - India 2000, and another, whose name I forget. It's the title of an album devoted to Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Awesome music, typical of Dr Subramaniam.
__label__2 Great pot: This pot is the perfect size for making soup, which is the main purpose for which i purchased it. It is high quality and attractive. I purchased it because i wanted a high quality product that would last a long time, and so far am very happy with this saucepan/
__label__2 Excellent Resource!: As a registered interior designer and certified Feng Shui professional, I found this book to be an interesting read. It will help designers and architects, as well as homeowners, analyze space and make informed decisions as to build or remodel. The charts are easy to follow and right on point. This book is filled with illustrations that are wonderful in demonstrating the ideas being presented. The "forward thinking" floorplans at the end of the book show that these two authors understand the diversity of how people live today and how their homes could be better designed to meet their needs.
__label__1 only for 3m/10ft under the surface.: if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool, it's ok. but,if you are the open water diver, please don't buy it. i try it yesterday, it will not work after 10m/33ft, it will show the red screen and count down timer, it scare me. and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday's dive. it's really disappointed to me.
__label__1 My brand new DVD was cut short and had no ending!: I was really excited to get my movies, but extremely disappointed when the first movie I watched (Robin Hood Prince of Thieves) cut short of the ending. It just went blank in the middle of the movie as if it had no ending. I tried going back to the main menu and choosing a scene I also trie fast forwarding to it. It was NOT there!!!! My movie is defective... what do I do now???
__label__1 Junk: Tons of static and I have a direct line running from this into my car stereo (NOT FM TUNER). It charges fine and cuts off ipod when I turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable. I would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car.
__label__1 Just say it, already!: Long, slow, New Orleans-in-the-thirties talkfest filled with hystrionics and over-acting. Hepburn is excellent, playing a Southern grande dame with a decidedly New England accent, Taylor is gorgeous (complete with full makeup, tight dresses, and stilettos while incarcerated) and shreiks a lot, while Clift appears catatonic and bug-eyed throughout. McCambridge minces about with a silly, shrill drawl and looks ridiculous.The whole point of the movie is summed up in one sentence, but it takes 113 minutes to get to it.If you like Tennessee Williams' long-winded speeches, you'll love this movie. I didn't.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: This cover lasted just over year before it started self destructing. The fabric has become so weak that just grabbing the cover with my bare hand causes it to tear.
__label__1 A masterpiece that won't be able to transcend time...: This is not the book it purports to be. The rights to the book were bought by another company and the book was rewritten so much that the book is unrecognizable. I bought this as a reading copy to the older original version of the book(A 3rd edition from 1908). Man, was that a mistake. DON'T BY THIS BOOK! it's not the original, it's a travesty.<sidenote:Amazon mispelled the title(tracend?)
__label__2 Too many beans! other wise the best: I could not argue that this book has been a great help and the examples are very practical indeed. Many mistery unfold and I could finally get the Internationalize things to work. However, in order to make things easy, you'll have to use the Beans that the author have created for you! Which means you may not fully understand what's behind the scene. I understand that using Beans keeps your code nice and tidy and make good practice. But when you have to understand the codes other people have done you'll also have to understand their Beans too!
__label__1 The Toolbox Murders: Based on what true story? the film is just shock for the pure sake of shock kind of a seventies saw minus the gore,the movie has it's moments but it belongs where it came from,It also apparently has a bone to pick with fundamentalism.I saw the remake first which is Ultra-Violent and an improvement if you can call it that, but both films are garbage and disturbing,I'll stick with my watered down horror flicks and leave the ultra violent stuff elsewhere.
__label__1 Freud compound mitre saw broken motor shaft: While sawing a 2x4 stud a knot in wood came out and lodged shearing and twisting motor shaft into. This saw may be ok for small work such as picture frames etc. but would not recommend for heavier work.
__label__2 Good information in the midst of lots of superflousage.: The stretching exercises are probably worth the price of admission - together with Brownstein's testimonials of how badly he hurt and was helped by them. Back pain isn't funny and the industry that's grown up around it is disproportionate to the relief it provides. Here may be some help.
__label__2 My daughter loves this toy: My 13 month old daughter loves to hit the drum. She loves to let her little fingers press the music button. Her dad and I know the music by heart. It might be annoying but she LOVES it.
__label__1 In a word, don't.: Any resemblance between this film and Clive Cussler's novel is purely accidental. If you want a prime example of how "Hollywood" can butcher a film adaptation of a book, here it is. The sequence of events doesn't come anywhere close to the book, and the ending is so different you will wonder if the screenwriter bothered to read it first.There is one plus; John Barry's score is powerful and majestic. But don't buy this video to hear it. Go for the cd.Instead of buying this video, take your 10 bucks and set fire to it. You will probably find it more entertaining.
__label__1 Weak Speakers: The speakers are cheap and weak. It looks ok and is functional, but the sound quality just isn't there.
__label__2 Very fun read: This eclectic collection of writing was loaned to me by a friend who thought it would be right up my alley. She was right! I had never heard of the series and am now seeking out the other years of "Nonrequired Reading." Every selection is different, so you are bound to love something in here. Several entries had me giggling delightedly. Others had me crying. Most I just enjoyed without any sloppy emotionalism. Definitely recommended.
__label__2 Nude, Nude, Nude: With the title of the movie, there is no doubt you will get to see nudity, but this film is much better than that. It is the best non-Jean Rollin film in the DVD Redemption line, and the only one in my collection other than the Rollin films.Surreal, creepy, the lovely Rita Calderoni, in her most nude role, and all the campy goth and eerie locations and characters that a classic 70's sexploitation horror film should be. A classic.
__label__1 Thyroid Solution: I was disappointed in this product because it didn't reveal any information that couldn't be found already published in magazines. I guess if you didn't know anything about thyroid then it would be helpful but I'm pretty informed about this subject thru my daughter, husband and aunt all having it was really hoping I would find more solutions to help them with their thyroid.
__label__2 NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS: AGAIN, I invite Carrie to see the movie... Burton and Elfman movies are the best. Great director and great composer.
__label__1 A creepy book: I did read this as a child, and though I could not have articulated the unpleasant feeling it gave me--I never liked it, that sad, vaguely arlarmed, looking doll, or the text. As an adult I find it very creepy. The doll who is so lonely and invites in a domineering father figure. THe bottom-up spanking is the illustration frequently complained about but they all invoke lonliness and passivity for me.
__label__2 Good Buy: First of all, i have to say the artwork is pretty good. I had read many negative reviews, mostly complaining about the changes...i really dont mind most of them, and i really like quite a few. Many hours of extras, documentaries, etc, plus the 6 movies make it well worth the money.
__label__2 Yes: I bump this in my truck at illegal speeds. Ayo for yayooooo! This guy has been doing it for a while too.
__label__2 Cutting Wedge: These seem to work great. I only need/use these a few times a year so I didn't splurge for the kind with metal striking faces. These seem to take a pounding just fine without a metal face.
__label__2 A Piece of Rock History: I saw this concert live 5 times. It was the first time Alice toured without the original band. It was the first time anyone saw a show like this. Later I saw the movie when it was released at a theater equipted with concert sound so it sounded great except Alice was in fact a little off with his singing. When I saw it was released on VHS and then DVD I thought it would sound as good as it was in the theater, but sadly the sound isn't up to par. Even though it is a piece of rock history and any collector should own it. Also a little trivia for you. One of the dancers in the show later became Mrs Alice Cooper (she's the woman dancing in Only Women Bleed) If your an Alice Cooper fan, you'll love this
__label__2 Enlightening, to say the least: Learning from a Nazi concentration camp survivor on how to find purpose and joy in the midst of pure and absolute Hell on earth was enlightening, to say the least.This book has everything to do with purpose and willpower.Purpose and willpower go hand in hand. The ability to constrain your options for something greater than this moment comes from having a meaningful purpose.
__label__1 My Dead Heart: I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard this CD. The title track is the worst I ever heard. There's no single right key in this playing. I felt asleep after 2 minutes.Even in a late night bar people should kill her.I give 0 stars
__label__2 Love it! Bought more than one!: I love this steamer! It is easy to use, easy to clean, and it gives consistent and tasty results. I started using it for steaming vegetables but it did so well that I expanded it use into other areas.I also use it to steam rice and even warm up left overs (it keeps them really moist). The only issues for doing left overs that the plastic does gets stained a bit if you use tomato-based sauce or curry in the dish.If there are left overs I use the steamer to store leftover in the refrigerator (I put a piece of plastic under the cover for a better seal).I found so many uses for it, that I bought a second one! Sometimes I use it for more than one things at the same time and I just wanted to have a spare just in case.
__label__2 Original and wonderfully fun to watch: If you enjoy quirky and dark humor, this is a delightful and thoughtful film. My wife and I are very happy to own this film.
__label__1 ENOUGH, IS ENOUGH, WHERE IS THE DVD?: I would never give Star Wars 1 star...EVER. However, enough is enough. This trilogy is one of the greatest ever made, no doubt, but where is the DVD? Star Wars has been re-released so many times, now we see George Lucas, not as a great director and story teller, but a business man who is just in this to make another buck. Give us, the fans, a break. Release these on DVD and stop wasting our time. This new set features about ten minutes of useless EPISODE 2 footage, that tells us nothing {we already know its too soon to expect anything COOL} So my advice is not to buy this one, unless your a die hard fan who wants to keep this one on the shelf.....WRAPPED of course.
__label__2 One of the greatest live bands ever: I had the good fortune of seeing these guys live over 50 times never a bad show. Well except for greenstock!!
__label__2 One of '99's most fun CDs: With all the reviews already written, I guess I can't add too much new. What I will say that it is the CD equivalent of taking shiny happy people pills. The trippy, but cool music never fails to liven up the surroundings. It's great to put on a CD that almost all ages can enjoy, plus I don't have to cringe because the music is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator (two steppin', trad retread rock, line dancing and so on). Far better than their last CD; they took the ideas of 'Walking on the Sun' and ran away with it. Nothing wrong with that. Get this one if you just want some trippy fun music.
__label__1 Boring, boring, boring: I'm a fan of Nichols Sparks and loved Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. But this movie was boring. I didn't buy the chemistry between the two leads which just made the movie drag. My wife said the movie differed quite a bit from the book and said the movie would have been better if they would have followed the book more closely.
__label__2 A good place to start: I am devouring Elizabeth George's series starring Detective Lynley and his cohort Barbara Havers. I started with some of George's more recent books and realized that you really should read them in the order they were written, so I bought "A Great Deliverance". It is not as good a read as subsequent books in her series but in my opinion it is a necessity to read and read first. It will help you develop the characters in your mind and thus help you understand them later.What if you have already read her more recent books? Should you skip it? Absolutely not, it is well written and entertaining and it will help you understand Lynley and Haver's relationship and how it developed in to the well oiled machine it is in later novels.
__label__1 A little goes a long way: I love Diana Palmer, well the older version anyway, but this attempt into writing historicals is lame, but all the attempts Ms Palmer has made into this genre the same.I wish Ms Palmer would read some of her old books, and go back to what made us fall in love with the big insecure Texans in the first place.
__label__1 fraud beware: you will receive maybe 2 or 3 magazines after that none!. Beware fraud! its not just me review all comments before ordering
__label__2 search party: i liked the part about the dog.he seemed to know what his master was thinging a very kine connection i have a dog and they do seem to know when people are hurting. the love between the dog and the wolf was different also.
__label__1 Nothing new here: The good thing about this book is that it does show pictures of lofts....that's about it. It showcased some lofts that have been pictured in other books before, and the picture quality is not always the best(at times the photographs look as though they were taken twenty years ago or with bad film). I usually read my design books but after about halfway through, I just looked at the pictures. Save your money for something else.
__label__2 THE BEST BOOK FOR BEGINNER'S THAT I'VE READ!: I OWN 14 BOOKS ON DYING AND SILK PAINTING NONE AS EASY TO READ AS THIS BOOK. YOU CAN TRY THE PROJECTS WITH A LOW INVESTMENTIN SUPPLIES. I FOUND GOOD SOLID DIRECTIONS FOR USING FIBIR REACTIVE DYES. THIS CAN BE USED TO OPEN NEW COLOR SELECTIONS FOR QUILTERS AS WELL AS WEARABLE ART PROJECTS. THERE ARE PROJECTS FOR CHILDREN & ADULTS. BEST PRICE TO VALUE RATIO I HAVE SEEN
__label__2 This Isn't Pirates Of The Carribean!!!: Why do people compare this movie to Pirates of the Caribbean!? It's the exact opposite of Pirates. Life onboard a ship is seen as joyless, cold, dark, and dirty. NOT glamoures! And this movie can actually be taken seriously!I thought this movie was a wonderfully great film! This generation's DasBoot. Very intense and emotional thought out the entire film. Deserves Oscars in every category!!!
__label__1 Good, but could be better: This game is fun and the humor is pretty good. There are references to the show itself, and I truly do enjoy Comic Book Guy's numerous cliches.The problem with this game, as others have indicated in their reviews, is the gameplay. I've never played a game where the camera angle is the biggest obstacle in the game, but that is the case here. It's a struggle to get the view you need to accomplish certain tasks. Then when you do, it can change on you by itself while you are in the middle of some critical action.Bottom line, it's a good game that could be great if the designers just cleaned up the gameplay. That's always the most important part of any game.
__label__1 Lady Knight: I thought this book was good,but not as good as Pierce's previous books. In Lady Knight, it seemed that Kel's attitude changed,and she seemed less human. The book did not play as heavily on her faults as the others did. There was no mention of her fear of heights. While it was a wonderful tribute to those who died in 9-11, the book itself was sadly lacking. The climax was built up remarkably well, but the book just. . . ended. In this book, Kel seems more superhuman, and less kind towards people. Her treatment of Tobe and several of the others in the camp reflects this. I didn't like that part. The book also doesn't mention some of the things that were very important to Kel in Squire, Page, and First Test. It was like Kel was truly a noble, and not someone who was kind and fair to people. Though she was very fair in her treatment with people in this book.
__label__1 Dissapointing and frustrating: The bulk of this book is step-by-step guided exercises that I had hoped would demonstrate the myrad features in Photoshop Elements. A CD containing art work and support files required by the exercises is furnished with the book.Unfortunately, my experience with a half dozen exercises left me less than pleased. Some of the exercise steps described items in Photoshop Elements that didn't exist. In some cases I found things that came close... I think. My guess is the author was working with a different version of the program as he was developing the book and never went back to check things with the final version. A further complication were several instances where the instructions called for files on the CD that didn't exist. Finally, the author provides cookbook-like instructions without saying what it is you are trying to accomplish.
__label__1 A suitable treatment for insomniacs.....: Save your money on this one. It severly lacks the intensity of her previous efforts, which goes to show you that you can't be target all the time. Hopefully her next one will be on par of "Siginificant Others, Between Friends, and the Color of Love."
__label__2 Way too easy: This would be a great puzzle for beginning mystery puzzlers, especially kids. But even before the puzzle is put together, the answer practically hits you over the head. I knew who the killer was in about three seconds flat after having put together less than half of it.As for durability, it is probably very strong when a kitten is not trying to devour it.
__label__2 Shallow but enjoyable: Shootem Up! Shootem Up! Pow! Pow! This movie, and these characters, are so over the top they are almost cartoonish. The stunts are ridiculous, and the plot line is pretty far out there. Even with all that, this is a "fun" movie to watch. It reminds me of the old action movies, where the hero was capable of anything but death. Only complaint, it was about 30 minutes too long...
__label__2 It's strange...: Strange that I actually like this series!! I'm more into the mystery/gory stuff, but this series got me obsessed!! I got my friends hooked, as well! I'm happy Conner woke up and saw Liz. As for Jessica, girl, Jeremy's the one! I know that Melissa is gonna get it. Soon, I hope. Can't wait for the next one...I get these books the day they come out! Unfortunately, you gotta wait a month to get it. The diary entries are the best; especially Conner's "I know..." Have to read it to find out, my friend! Email me for comments.
__label__2 Yoga Video: Recieved the shipment earlier than expected. Really like all of her videos. Easy to follow instructions. Has really helped me so much physically and mentally. Anyone having problems with high stress in their lives could really benefit from these videos.
__label__2 SWEET AND SAVORY: The Chipotle and Ranch almonds is by far my favorite flavor. It's savory and sweet at the same time. I was sad when Starbucks stopped carrying these. Good thing Amazon have these available. Happy eating!
__label__2 She does it again!: I bought this book knowing that I would be reading something wonderful by one of the best authors in the genre. Mercedes Lackey writes with flair and style. The story of Levan Firestorm pre-dates many of her other books in the series, but you really don't have to read the others to be immersed in the world she creates for you. Her writing spurs the imagination so adequately that you feel, hear and taste every nuance and emotion the characters in this book have. Again she does what few authors do. She creates a land, people, and experiences that make you avid to read anything else she has written. This book is a must read!
__label__1 Acrylic Earring Keeper - Holds 37 Pair: Very Disappointed! The item was Not well pack and therefore causes the product with some damaged. i feel it is not as useful as i thought. Quantity of the product also pretty lbad. Not worth the money at all!!! I will not recommend it to anyone!
__label__2 A must read for all Fusebox users: If you are serious about CF development FB 4 is the way togo and the book is a must read. Well worth the money. The guys did a great job.(...)I am a CF developer for 6 years now and I've been using Fusebox 2/3/4.There wasn't really any need for a book about FB till now. With FB 4 this really changed.What can I say!? Fusebox 4 is what I have been waiting for.Finally I see the use of the MVC concept - and with Fusebox 4I got everything I need no implement it.The book is clearly structured and gave me all the backgroundinformation that I needed to understand FB 4. Everything iscovered from the very basics to the FuseQ and the memory structures.Although there are a lot of details covered itis still easy to read and not overloaded.
__label__1 Don't buy.this here: You can purchase this exact item on the AMSN web site for $149.00 for non-members and $129.00 for members.
__label__1 Might be okay: We purchased wanting butter flavored salt - turns out this is just very fine salt with no butter flavoring. We returned it.
__label__2 A Real Christmas Album: Some familiar, some not so familiar, all in the iconic voice of JT. It's one of the few Christmas albums that I don't pick and choose the gems and place the rest in a (no) playlist. I keep coming back.
__label__1 Binding fail: I bought the book "Bride of Deimos vol. 2" and the description was "like new" but the moment I opened the book, the whole cover, back cover and binding fell apart.
__label__2 Kim makes me crazy...: I love all the Biggest Loser workouts, and I own all of Jillian Michaels's DVDs as well. I workout 5-6 nights per week, and even though I am in pretty good shape these Biggest Loser DVDs kick my butt! I love the power sculpt DVD because it really flies by, 3 different segments with each trainer really helps, plus you really feel it in your muscles the next day. I also love working out with "real people" on the videos-mistakes and all. The one complaint I have is Kim-her voice drives me INSANE and I now realize why she is no longer on the tv show. Her segment's workouts are pretty good, but unfortunately I am so disctracted by her voice that I am just waiting for it to be over...
__label__2 Aaron's review: Checked several sources for this book and found it listed for much less than elsewhere. Very happy with this purchase
__label__2 Well researched and written: C.P.Shrivastava who was the Private Secretary to one of India's Prime Ministers, later becoming a distinguished diplomat at the UN, has seen first hand what happens with the struggle for power and wealth against doing what is right for society. Written in an easy to read style.
__label__2 powerful sounds: an advanced exploration of sound from the incredible band that laid the groundwork for just about every electronic band of the past twenty years.Adventurous, mind-blowing and memorable.
__label__2 Turbo Tax better than Tax Cut: I don't understand why reviewers of tax software even compare TurboTax to TaxCut. TaxCut just doesn't have have the power of TurboTax Basic! It wouldn't print on my old Panasonic MFC printer...I had to buy a new printer just to print out forms...did not have this problem with TurboTax. There are many more specific comparisons where TaxCut comes up short. Save yourself trouble and angst...use TurboTax. I have used it since it came out and made a mistake trying to use TaxCut one year.
__label__1 Forget it if you have dial-up: I am a very long-time user of TurboTax and Quicken and am an IT professional. I have dial-up at home (where I use the software), and have previously had no problems downloading the upgrades or the state products. However this year, despite contacting customer support several times, getting a CD from them to upgrade the Federal (which was supposed to correct the problem downloading the state) and calling a toll-free number given by me by a customer service rep to get the state tax CD (which said when I called it that they had too many callers and so had blocked the line!!), I am still without the state. Am not sure what I am going to do.
__label__2 best yet: glad to see blinks gettin a little more punk... not as selloutish as their other stuff. best yet, keep it comin!
__label__2 U can watch it a few times: I bought it to watch it when I am travelling. I carry my PSP only when I am flying. This is an ok movie to watch a couple of times.
__label__2 Good Cables: They fit snugly, with no possibility of falling out. They do the job at a fraction of the price of other cables that are no better. Also, they include a full 6" of cable, which is way more than many other cables. If you are concerned about length, don't be. You would have to have a monster sized computer for these cables not to reach. All in all, a very good buy.
__label__2 Youll find this book useful: This is a very informative book. It's full of submissions from numerous hackers which boosts both its insight and readability. Despite the book's title as 'hackers' are 'attackers', instead the hackers come across as intelligent, funny, computer-obsessed experimenters who can't resist a challenge. With over 900 pages, whose value lies in the hints & tips and graphical examples. The CD is loaded with goodies and some folks will find it useful to have all you need in one place. There are also extensive walkthroughs of some topics which makes it unique in this category.
__label__1 The "death" of good metal!: Some dude at the CD store was looking at different albums by this band called "Death" so I asked him if they were any good. He said, "Yeah they're brutal! They're one of the best metal bands EVER!!" so under his recommendation I bought "Sound of Perseverance". I put it in my new 2001 CD player and was expecting some tr00 metal. Man, I was so disappointed. All the songs sound the same, the guitar riffs are Metallica ripoffs, the drums sound like tin cans and the vocals sound like a crying angsty teenager.For real metal listen to new Metallica, KoRn, Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, As I Lay Dying, Trivium and Job For A Cowboy!
__label__2 Every track is great: I've played this double-CD for my friends, and every one of them is crazy about it. Every track is an eclectic blend of ethnic-infused, downtempo groove that puts a rhythm in your walk. My favorites are the two versions of "Laissez Moi Me Griser," but all of the tracks are great. I'm happy to see it's available in the U.S. now...buy it while you can!
__label__1 just working: Apart from the fiddly nature of the charger it does all it says apart from the one main thing if you intend to have it connected to your car whilst driving the charger is not shielded thus a ridiculously loud hum can be heard through the sound system as it charges for the sake of a cheap shielding mechanism to prevent this problem could be easily solved buy at your own peril
__label__2 could aways be a bit better: e-mail: .mac (imap) is greatweb page/idisk: easy to upload + editbackup: great bonusphotocasting: ehhh, used it only oncesync: it's the biggest bonus, because all of the above you can basically get for free elsewhereis it worth the money? each year I'm asking myself the same question and somehow continue to use the service hoping that it would bring new and attractive features that other companies don't offer yet. I'm happy with it the way it is but it's quite expensive!
__label__2 Best Tools for Professionals: Seki Edge Toenail Clippers are the best around for professional Nail Technicians. Drugstore nail clippers are dull and crumble the nails. Not so with the Seki-Edge! They last about 18 months with frequent pedicure clients and continuous soaking in barbicide. The hinge will probably rot out after 18 months ( due to chemical exposure), but the clipping blades would keep on cutting! Great for retail too! I wouldn't use another toe nail clipper for my professional business (or at home for that matter).
__label__2 Looks very good: Bought it from Dillards, looks very good and versatile as dress watch or party watch with the more modern crocodile leather design.
__label__1 mediocre: I was really disappointed in this album, because I really liked the music in the movie. The best track was McClintock's original 1928 version of 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', but I would have been much happier buying a Dr. Demento collection with that on it. The 'Nobody But the Baby' track sung by the sirens seemed better mixed in the movie, which made it more evocative, and that may have been the problem with 'Man of Constant Sorrow' too.
__label__2 The Attack: Not only a great story, but reveals insight into points of view about the Arab/Israeli conflict not often understood in our country.
__label__1 Mad Money, Bad Times: From the very first moments you wonder if this is the final version of the film or a rehearsal intended to show how the movie has to "look".A comedy that doesn't have any funny moments, a heist-flick with no excitement, and performances by marquee-name stars hat don't deliver, but rather dissapoint.This movie is to be avoided and not even paid money would make me watch it again.
__label__1 Ick!: What a complete disappointment. One star was too generous. This is a schlocky piece of supposed Judaica. The maker should hang his head in shame. Inferior materials and construction. I returned it.
__label__2 ELVIS GOSPEL FAVORITES: MY WIFE IS A LOVER OF GOSPEL MUSIC. SHE SAW A TV SHOW THAT FEATURED EDVIS SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC AND THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL. I LOOKED ONLINE AT YOUR SIGHT AND FOUND JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR - ELVIS SINGING GOSPELFAVORITES.THE MUSIC, TYPICALLY, WAS VERY GOOD AND ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO, EVEN THOUGH I, MYSELF, AM NOT A REAL GOSPEL MUSIC ENTHUSIAST.
__label__1 Good for AA, very bad for AAA: Frankly, I would check out another brand. This one is expensive, and frustrating if you use AAA batteries. AAA batteries pop out of the charger every time I use it. Sometimes it pops out immediately or almost immediately. Other times I feel victorious in getting all the batteries to stay in the charger, only to later find a couple of them have popped out. I get around it by doing the obvious: I simply put all four batteries in, and charge only two (after two have popped out). Then I repeat the process. So after trying 4 twice, of the 8, I get 5 actually charged, which is all I need.
__label__1 Underoath ehhhhh: This CD is basically unlistenable. It's just loud with a bunch of screaming of uninteligable lyrics with nothing memorable or likable. Dont waste your money. There's better CDs out there.
__label__1 poor blade clamp: The blade clamp does not will not hold blades tightly enough to let them be adequately tensioned. Tension may be sufficient for cutting VERY thin stock, but I was using this to cut away waste on dovetails, per Cosman video. Blades immediately pulled out of the blade clamp and brokeBought another fret saw without the rotating blade feature, and it works fine.
__label__1 Don't Risk Damaging Your Paper Shredder: Shred a $50 bill instead of this game, your paper shredder will thank you.
__label__1 Not a good LP CD, not a good CD in general.: Be weary of people who rate this album 5 stars. 5 means perfection, music that will stand the test of time. This, citizens of rock; is not even close. I will be honest, I like me some Linkin Park. I have seen them twice in concert and in general, I enjoy their music. I don't worship them or write 8 page diatribes in their defense if someone decides to flame them. This album has to be heard to be believed. I was moved by it, moved to come on here and warn people that this not what you expect. Whatever idea you have of this album it wont be that. There are no punch to the songs. They removed every musical aspect which made them, them. I mean, honestly the songs simply put, the songs aren't any good.In a interview they said they made hundreds of songs and these made pick. Linkin Park, did you even listen to this album before you presented it to us, your fans? This is awful you should be ashamed of yourself, go to your room.
__label__1 Self indulgence at best: Mostly these guys all sound like someone else, Alan Holdsworth, Jeff Beck, Joe Zawinul and others. Very little originality or substance. And how come fusion guitarists never have good tone? It is well recorded I'll say that much.
__label__1 Unsafe seat, and bad customer service: I received my travel system for a shower gift in September. The stroller worked okay, but the carseat..oh my gosh! The straps come loose every time I used it. I was under the impression this product had been recalled (misunderstood) and I contacted my local Target. The manager advised me to bring the stroller back for an exchange, no problem. When I attempted to do so today, I was told there was no recall on this by an extremely rude worker. Glad I've given them so much of my business.
__label__2 Thoughts & Feelings: Taking Control of Your Moods and Your Life: A Workbook of Cognitive Behavioral Techni: just the job
__label__2 Great pick but not for shredding: Great pick but not for shredding on your guitar. I like Jazz iii pick better because it's smaller and comfortable when you hold it
__label__2 A great supense high tech thriller!!: This murder mystery kept us guessing up till the last page. Well written book that explains how people really do operate in the fast paced Silicon Valley. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
__label__1 Horrible singing and playing on the CD: I had only a short look at the book itself and it appears to me to be OK (say 3 stars worth). When I bought the book during holiday, I alas have not had the opportunity to listen to the accompanying CD - a grave mistake and the reason for the ONE STAR.Both the singing and the guitar(s) playing are truly repulsive: the singer is off-key an estimated 30% of the time and his voice generally breaks with the moderately to high notes. The guitar playing is uninspired, appears to be off-beat a bit too much, and I have the idea that the guitar(s) are significantly out of tune in half of the songs.
__label__2 Perfect fit but was lucky: If anyone knows about Levis Jeans, it is a hit and miss when it comes to size. I would go to the brick and mortar store and try on 3-4 of the exact same jean and size and they would all be of different length and width. So, I knew if I ordered online that I was taking a gamble. With this in mind, I thought I would try. It was packaged well and came on time. Tried it on and it fit both waist and length and the color was perfect. I was happy and wear them every day. That being said, I thought I would take another gamble and order another one but of darker color but I pushed my luck. It was much longer in length and I had to return it. Overall, I was too busy to go to the store so I tried amazon and it worked out the first time only. I do appreciate their return service and the fair pricing as well as their fast delivery. I'll try again one day but hate to waste Amazon's time since they have been so good to me and my family.
__label__1 School book which I never read: I hate when professors make you buy a book and then don't even reference it.
__label__2 The only research by the founder of structuralist anthropolo: This is one of the funniest books ever written by french intellectuals. The only field work ever done by the founder of structuralist anthropology, who preferred to work from his Paris armchair, its centerpiece is an account of how Claude loses touch with the rest of the company and in the process of trying to find them by firing his revolver, also scares his pack-mule away and thereafter discovers the dangers of writing.
__label__1 ordered two, one broken: Yes it's cheap. That doesn't mean it's worth buying. I ordered two of these. One seems to work fine. The other only had one working earpiece. I had to send it back for a replacement (pain in the but), and I have to hope the replacement doesn't fail too. DAVE says "be forewarned."
__label__2 Incredibly usable PC at an incredibly low price: I got my V2405US at a 'blow out' sale at an office supply store - about $500, and it was new, in box, and no rebate funny business. I never expected to buy from an office supply store, and the price made me worry it was a piece of junk. After a month of use, I am totally impressed with this PC. (For proper context, I use it for email, calendar, web surfing, photo vault, and GPS navigation). I am comparing it to a top-of-the-line HP 'desktop replacement' and a Sony Vaio TX650 - I like this one the most of all 3, yet it is 1/4 the price of the other two.The build quality is great, the display is beautiful, all the hardware I need is there, but most of all the *keyboard* is so easy to type on. With a USB mouse, I could see using this as my only computer
__label__2 happy mom: This product is so much more accurate than any thing else that is on the market. Thank you.
__label__1 The voices are the best actors: The acting in this movie is horrible! The best parts are played by the trains them selves. My son loves the movie but is only 3 and only sees Thomas. The story is okay and I like that they use the original look of Thomas but that's the only good points of the entire movie.
__label__1 Pop history: As a Polish scholar with interest in 2. WW and Holocaust I can only say - pop history. I hate, when filmmakers don't tell the whole truth or manipulate it. This movie is full of mistakes - right from beginning. October 1941 - surprise, surprise - Germans interrupt a wedding! But in the Fall 1941 Jews have been treated as animals in 2 years already and at least in a year they lived in ghettos. Deportation - discussion with Germans? Absurd! No selection before departure and after arrival? No way. KZ prizoners look quite healthy and fed up. And where are all this people stuffed together in KZ camps? No money for actors?A romantic story with a tiny relation to the hell of Shoa.If you want to see a movie closer to reality of Jews destiny see Spielbergs Schindlers List, see Polanskis The Pianist.
__label__1 Bloody Bad: This book has no insight, no important details, and no excitement. Written hastily and poorly. Needs revising and needs passion; something this book utterly lacks.
__label__1 Doesn't work: I' ve had the same problem as many reviewers here: the water bottle stops working. Our pet rats had been without water for days because of it, but thankfully we finally realized that something is wrong. I can't believe that with so many complaints and dead animals, the company still hasn't recalled this bottle. Would never buy anything by "Super Pet" again, obviously they care much more about their bottom line than about pets.
__label__1 Excessive Code and re-directs to his first book: I bought this book online and never had a chance to preview it first hand. It's amazing how some books get published. There are constant references to his previous book. It crazy how many pages are just code. Nice if your a programmer I guess. Many references to their 'great' security programs too. Towards the end of the book there is 20 pages of a discovery, for what???? The one plus is the chapter on security policies. It's nothing outstanding, but compared to the rest of the book, it's literary art. Buy another book like 0735708681, which covers the same material, but is excellent.
__label__1 disapointed: It was exactly what I was looking for but, the product is defective.First one I received, the cassette door was not workable.The second one had a problem with the c d not playing.Had to return it twiceWay too much troubles, not worth it!
__label__1 Where is it???: I ordered this on the 16th of February. I have received all my items I ordered before AND after I ordered this product.
__label__2 Peppermint Oil: Received in a short time. Bottles intact. We use this product for a room freshner AND we heard it helps to repel bugs/mice ... it leaves a good strong smell that implies, "CLEAN!" Several cotton balls soaked and left in stategic locations around room AND above ceiling tiles lasts for weeks and so far, seeing little evidence of bugs/mice.
__label__2 Fabulous: I loved this book. Although it is completely different from the beloved Leaphorn/Chee characters, Hillerman's style is there and great as usual. I found it both suspenseful and moving. Loved it!
__label__1 Love the watch but resin band is junk: I love the features of the watch (the easily settable countdown timer in particular - great for timing foods on the grill!) but the resin part of the case holding the band broke after just 3 months. The one year warranty doesn't help because it doesn't cover the band (or the crystal - which got scratched pretty easily).The warranty repair process is painful: register online, send in your watch (at your cost), Casio sends you an email either saying the repair is covered under warranty and they'll fix or replace it, or they send you an email with the cost to fix the watch. In my case the the cost to fix it was $35 while the watch itself cost $27! Plus there's no option to just have them send back the original watch - you either pay up or let Casio "recycle" it. Boo.
__label__2 A very "real" fantasy: In the third installment of The Demon Series, Brooks does a wonderful job of again captivating the reader and bringing them along for the ride. One never feels like a simple spectator. In this brave fantasy series set in our world and our time Brooks uses ideas and prblems we all face to create a fantasy yarn that doesn't seem that hard to believe. This is a riveting book, and I was truly surprised at the ending of this one (I had guessed pretty much the end of Kight of the Word). I hope that this is not the last installment in this series as there are so many avenues still to explore. I wasn't disappointed!
__label__2 Beware of sizing: I own this helmet (bought in a local store, sadly not as cheap as Amazon) and absolutely love it! However, I am a full-grown adult, not a child, so I advise you to be careful if buying this for younger kids or kids with smaller heads. I actually had to use the thicker comfort pads to get the right fit and I am not a small person (though my head is about 21 inches around and I'm not sure what average is). A helmet that's too big provides too much wiggle room and is pretty useless if you actually need it to protect your head, since it'll move and not protect your skull and could even cause further injury.Be sure to measure you or your child's head before buying! Big helmets=big accidents
__label__2 Great for Kennel: We bought two...one for our 6 month old lab's kennel and one for just having her own "place" by the tv. Not super thick but for the price we got, it's just fine. Haven't cleaned it yet, so don't know how well it holds up in the washer.
__label__1 Disapointed, Maysa's KARAOKE CD: I love maysa's voice and music which had been pleased my ear for years. But this is under average of her music.Her music on those Top 10 classic songs are only KARAOKE quality ( Record company wants Easy-money )Not good back music-a bad arragement with cheap sound.I don't think anybody would get impressed by her singing of "FEEL THE FIRE",After people listen Stephanie Mill's version & Teddy's or Peabo Bryson's version (original).I want Maysa would go back what she used to do
__label__2 Mum Mums are great for young eaters: Great snack for young eaters. These are tasty, and interesting, for my almost one year old, she loves to "bite" foods and is avoiding baby foods, but still loves MumMums. Started giving them at about 4 months old, and never had any issues with choking. A really great snack, that does NOT make a big mess.
__label__2 Regarding Science-Ejected Vitalism, 2002:: Vitalism is a profoundly science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals falsely claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.This book is a prime example of naturopathy's vitalism [aka "vis medicatrix naturae"].I quote:"naturopathy [...] the main aim of diagnosis is to find out how well your vital force is working [...in naturopathy,] hydrotherapy may be used to help stimulate the body's vital force [p.058]."-r.c.
__label__2 Terrific Piano Book. Learn Piano the Interesting Way: This is a terrific book on the piano and learning to play the piano. I am taking piano lessons with a piano teacher but find this book a great addition. Carl Humphries is a clear, concise writer who gives you a wealth of information. I've had this book for almost a year now and find myself continually referring back to it and pulling it out to play or replay a favorite piano piece. His selection of music is wonderful with charming works that you'll fall in love with and return to time after time.
__label__2 A GREAT Workout: The workout is great. It provides a new and fresh slant to yoga. The 'Better Sex' is an interesting angle, but this is a GREAT yoga tape on its own.
__label__1 Another Disappointed Fan: This game had everything going for it, even Walter and George reprising their roles as Sulu and Chekov, but the game just falls flat. The levels are repetitive and very difficult, almost impossible even with invinciblity as another reviewer here said. The game gets old fast, the game play is just the same thing every level.This game is also very dull, I tried to play this game twice and I always stop by the fourth level. The story itself seems messed up since the Excelsior crew transforms into their mirror characters in the game when in the real mirror universe in Trek, there is already someone in an alternate universe that looks like you but acts different. The game just feels really slapped together and made for gaming pros because the game is HARD. That can't be said enough.
__label__2 Excellent value, spirited interpretations of bossa nova clas: This CD is comprised entirely of Antonio Carlos Jobim's works, sans his over-played Girl from Ipanema. The quartet has a light but soulful, at times melancholy voice, and the cello is an unusual but lovely addition to the traditional bossa nova ensemble. Not as utterly perfect as the classic Stan Getz-Joao Gilberto album, but this album gives you good value for money and is an ideal mood-setter for that sultry afternoon at the beach.
__label__2 Great Features / Poor WiFi: I received a Soundbridge for Christmas and love the features it has to offer. Setup is easy and straight forward. Once on the network, the product auto detects available music servers and offers relativaly easy navigation throught the archive. With Rhapsody, I've had the player streaming subscription media without issue.I do have to echo the complaint of other reviewers. The WiFi reception is poor. I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that the Soundbridge runs 802.11b and that I have old plaster walls in my house. My laptop connecting on 802.11g has no problem at the same distance. I'll have to resort to running a wire instead.
__label__1 CD Player will stop working ; (: My 7 year old received this Bloombox as a Christmas gift in December of 2008. Sadly, the CD player did stop working today (after 7 months) just as other reviewers have mentioned. The current price on Amazon is OUTRAGEOUS!! Do not pay $60+ for this CD player, it's not worth it (ours cost around $30 last Dec from Amazon). My daughter is upset because she can not listen to her favorite music in her room until we find a good replacement. Cute radio, bad quality.
__label__2 Fantastic book: A great book and series. Well worth the read if your a fan of fantasy or just starting.
__label__2 UltraMan Tv Series: Ultraman is still fun to watch even though I am alot older than when it first aired. Now it is campy to me so I enjoy it on another level.
__label__2 Great Fun!: You will often hear others say that this lens is fun, and I totally agree with that. I may not know how to best use an ultrawide, but it has not stopped me from having fun with this lens.Distortion is a problem with any lens this wide, but there are ways to manage it. It's not your ideal lens for shooting people (although usable at the long end) but great for indoors, landscape and groups. It's also the only one where I can get usable shots shooting blind (just raise it over your head and shoot type of shots).My only regret is not getting this lens sooner. It's an expensive toy, but if you can afford it, you can take lots of fun shots with it.
__label__1 $42 for 13 episodes??? Gulp!: $42 for 13 episodes??? Gulp!Love the series, but what's the deal with the pricing?? I think Paramount is pining for the days when they were getting over $110 for seasons of Star Trek-The Next Generation!
__label__1 I luv no limit, but this was no good.: I love P, and Ghetto D was and still is my favorite CD of all time, but this was a dissapointment, especially if your going out. c'mon P you can do hella better than that, come out with another, make it good this time!
__label__2 Smaller size allows it to fit in your seat pack: I bought this tool because it's lighter and easier to pack. Other tools are bulky and if you pack an extra tube, co2 cartridges and other gear into your saddle pack it gets crowded real fast. It gets the job done and doesn't take up much space.
__label__1 A Day No Pigs Would Die: Robert Newton Peck's book, A Day No Pigs Would Die, is a great book for all ages. There are many enjoyable and unpleasant parts in the book. When Pinky, the pig, won the blue ribbon for the best-behaved pig was an enjoyable scene. When Pinky won the award, Robert, Pinky's owner, was very proud of himself for his work he had put into Pinky, and he was proud of Pinky for winning the prize. From the novel,I learned that one should always take care for a pet.
__label__1 bad dartboard: Was looking for a dartboard, with a cabinet for our basement game area. The product was price right. Upon receipt of the dartboard and unpacking, I realized that I had purchased a bad product. The unit came unassembled and what was really bad was the cabinet, with only staples to hold it together. I had to drill holes and screw it together. Was one of the worst products that I have ever purchased on line.
__label__1 Horrible as a cold pack: I purchased this specifically for cold use. I have never heated it up. However, even after days in the freezer it feels like your basic towel (if left in the freezer) and gets about as cold. Meaning, that it barely gets cold. So, my one star reflects the fact that they are selling this as a cold pack but it doesn't do the job. I just wish I still had the packaging so I could return it. (bought it locally).
__label__2 jamshe: This CD will make your heart smile with the lyrical and musical sounds of Julie Andrews and all the little ones. You cannot be sad when you listen to this music....It's a lot cheaper than a therapist. Please don't buy this if you don't want to be happy or have a song in your heart....
__label__1 Puzzling: I really don't understand the appeal this singer has for so many people, but I respect that he does. The nay-sayers are, of course, right: he has a voice that could never be taken seriously in an opeara house, as his disasterous Detroit debut last year painfully showed. But when amplified, filtered and electronically enhanced, it sounds rather uplifting. I sincerely hope that those listeners who like this will listen to real opera singers (who are NOT amplified, except in some kind of extravaganza like a Three Tenors exhibition); they will be blown away by what a truly great operatic voice is like. I promise you, it's very different. But why not enjoy this, if it gives pleasure?
__label__1 bad cat litter: first time we've had a cat littler the cat (18 years old) wouldn;t use. The littler disintegrates into sawdust as cat urine gets on it. The pieces are too large too sift through a litter scoop spoon. Don't buy it.
__label__2 Beautiful music!: I too bought this CD after seeing Woody play at the Cafe Carlyle, New York which was absolutely wonderful. This album captures the beauty and soaring tunes the band plays as well as the memorable mood of the evening. I urge everyone to buy this CD; this is true jazz at its best. I have played it over and over since buying it whilst the music remains in your heart and mind long after you switch off. The music soars, the songs are utterly happy yet also painfully sad at the same time. A real gem. Please make more of this music Woody and Eddie!
__label__2 Excellent addition to your library!: If you thought the first 2 editions were good, wait until you get the third edition: bigger and even more packed with information on old outboards! Peter's easy to read style makes this book a pleasure to read and re-read!
__label__2 great cane!: This lightweight cane is a great stability aide. I broke a hip then had knee replacement surgery and this quad cane has enabled me to move out of a walker. It's important to be sure the slightly offset feet are positioned to the outside so the cane remains stable and you don't get tripped. My physical therapist said the lighter cane is a great choice and would recommend it for other patients.
__label__2 A Fascinating Character Study!: Francis Ford Coppola's other 1974 classic (The Godfather Part II was the other classic). Great story of a moral man deteriorating at an immoral job. Gene Hackman gives a powerfully quiet performance that ranks among his best. The movie starts a little slow but then we begin to see how the character evolves and it becomes a fascinating journey. The last scene of Hackman tearing his appartment apart is among the most powerful scenes ever filmed. A great picture. Extras: spot the two 'American Graffiti' stars, and the two 'Godfather' stars. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!
__label__2 'The American Promise' Review: I love this text book. I bought this for my college history class, but this text was easy to read, with a lot of pictures. Reminded me of my history text book back in elementary/middle school, yet had valuable information and written clearly.
__label__1 Fear this Movie~ It Really S_cks !!!! :(: Frank Laloggia Directed this dreadful piece of Garbage w/ out much imagination or Talent !!! I think Mr. Laloggia should stick to being a Garbage man or Peepshow usher...What a Bozo !!!
__label__1 Car Adapter for GPS: Was sold to me as an accessory but wasn't needed because there was already one that came with the GPS. Had to return it.
__label__2 Pretty cool for cutting pineapple: Overall, I think this product is pretty useful and far less work than cutting pineapple with a knife. I purchased the version with multiple cutting sizes to accommodate different sized fruit. If you find cutting pineapple a chore and have room for one more gadget in your kitchen, you will probably appreciate this product. I really like this product for the quickness and ease of "gutting" most of the fruit from a pineapple. However, it's effectiveness does depend on how ripe your fruit is and whether the pineapple is firm or soft. If your fruit is pretty ripe and softening, then this product is a little bit messy and may "crush" your pineapple. If your fruit is quite firm, you may feel like you're getting an arm workout. But either way, with this item you can be snacking on the the heart of the pineapple fruit in two or three minutes - which is pretty cool.
__label__1 Get In Car, Go To Woods, Come Home: My title for this review is more than a synopsis of this film, it is the film. I would give this an "A," as a student film, but a definitive "F," as a DVD purchase (or rental). Two guys take a drive to the woods and come home. Along the way there are lingering shots of creatures and things: a crow, ants swarming, wedding ring on finger, and a slug. This attempt at symbolism seems contrived and accomplishes nothing. Another reviewer said that this film is 'beautifully nuanced.' A nuance is subtly evocative. This film has no fragrance. I'm sure the filmmaker worked hard on this and had the best of intentions, but I just can't get behind this one.
__label__2 Author is refreshingly honest...: I heard the author on a radio show here and was struck by his honesty. I am a life-long Democrat so I disagree with his political views but this was a fun read.
__label__1 Not one of Fern Michaels' best!: This book had the potential to be very interesting, but the dialogue throughout seemed really fake. It was almost uncomfortable reading parts of it because you know that people would not interact that way in real life. If you're a big Fern Michaels fan, pick another book and skip this one!
__label__1 Don't waste your money!: I live in the Pikes Peak region in the mountains. The deer are a royal pain. Last year we bought some of the deer block netting and laid it down with stakes over all our perrenials. The deer would just move the rocks and push the netting aside. So this year we extended one side of our deck higher and had a tent over our gardens. It has been two days since our project completion. The first night the deer tore the areas where we twistied the netting together. Last night they not only tore holes through other areas where there were twisties, but they also chewed right through several other areas as well. This product is worthless and will not prevent the deer from eating your gardens. Wish I never bought it for my garden project. Now I am researching for something that actually will prevent the deer from chewing through it in order to save our garden. (P.S. I also use all sorts of sprays, and sprinkle deer repellant as well.)
__label__2 I, for one, LOVED IT!!!: I don't understand why people don't appreciate this movie, but I love it! I never buy movies in the age of streaming, but I bought this one. I'm gonna watch it again and again. Pure delight!
__label__1 Not usable with 4th Generation Nano Ipod: I purchased this item not knowing that it was not compatible with the 4th Generation Ipod. The description was unclear, I hope no one else makes the same mistake I did. So unfortunately, I am stuck with it because it would cost me more than I paid for it to return it. So I am just going to throw it in the trash. Lesson learned.
__label__1 misleading info: I bought this product to replace my original broken one and after I got it and used it, it worked but it only gave me 70w it was suppose to be 90w so now every time I plug it in or turn on my power with it plugged in a screen appears informing me of the situation. (Verry bothersome)
__label__2 Hilarious!: This book is really funny but it isn't going to teach you anything really about gambling and poker. He does give a few pointers, but it is basically the story of his life and what a story it was. It is a very easy book to read and enjoyable for anyone who likes gambling.
__label__2 Good for the price, but check sizing: It's a fine helmet, especially for the price, but it isn't adjustable, so be careful of the sizing. People have written about the foam insert, but I can barely tell the difference in sizes between the insert on the helmet and the extra one provided. Other than jury-rigging more padding into the lining of the helmet, you won't be able to change the circumference.
__label__1 Didn't Work: It seemed more trouble to return the memory but after trying it in several computers I was resigned to the fact it was no good.
__label__2 I love Winx Club: I love Winx and all the things with it. Around where i live, they have Winx Club on 4kids.tv at 6:30 AM, on Saturday. Who wants to get up that early just to watch a show? Well, I do. I love Winx. I'm thinking about getting everything in Winx availible before i die. I think its sooo cool with the fairys battling the monsters. If u like yu-gi-oh it kinda goes with it, except its more sensible. No offense to you yu-gi-oh fans,thats just the way I am. My fave epi is this one!<center><font color=periwinkle><font size=3> Close your eyes,and open ur heart believe in yourself,thats how it starts! Dreams will come true,just wait and see,cause the magic's in you,and the magic's in me!</font></font></center>
__label__1 wouldnt buy again: ?? Unscented ?? These down right stink. Will NOT be buying these againThe only pro is there softSeveral cons, THIN, STINK, Smaller than my usual brand
__label__2 Great read: Must read for an unglued woman... humour and every day challenges...and raw emotions.... guidance through God's Love,Grace and Mercy....backed up with Bible verses
__label__2 Good film: Lots of action and treats the Batman theme with a new twist and with a somewhat surprise ending. you will enjoy.
__label__1 Too man burned kernels and it smells terrible: I bought this a couple of years ago and it has been a total waste of money. It never worked as advertised, it is difficult to clean and I can't stand the smells that are produced when any oil or butter is used.At least a third of the kernels remain unpopped but are burned as is some of the popped corn.I tossed it in the trash rather than pass it on to another unsuspecting person.This appliance is a whole tree full of lemons and doesn't live up to the Cuisinart name. I have many other Cuisinart branded appliances and all work as advertised and I like them.This one is a bummer.
__label__1 who does yoga in tight cut-off jeans ?: it was more talk then action. he spoke sooo much and sooo loudly i couldn't even get into the dvd. his students did the poses, and he had close body contact to his students in "helping" them pose right. the times that he did do yoga seemed more like showing off then demonstrating. if i ever walked into his studio seeing him wearing greasy 80's hair and tight cut-off jeans, i would have ran the other way never looking back. im sorry i wasted my $7.00.sigh.
__label__1 Worst travel or art video ever!: This is easily the worst travel video of all time.One telling example is the Venus de Milo segment. This begins with a full screen title "Aphrodite...Venus de Milo" while the narrator reads "One of the most famous treasures is the perfectly formed statue of Aphrodite, better known as Venus de Milo." However, the video images throughout this segment are of Winged Victory. We never see Venus de Milo.The editing is poor. As the narrator describes a David painting, the video moves to a Watteau painting. The camera work is shaky and frequently crops the tops of art works.There are numerous other errors:> The number of exhibits in the Louvre is wildly exaggerated> The names of French kings are laughable> The history of how the Mona Lisa came to the Louvre is simple wrongThe length is only 10 minutes, thankfully.So poor is this DVD that I will be returning it to Amazon immediately.
__label__1 Piece of junk.: Despite being given tender loving care, after 18 months the timerwill go off and come back on causing a serious fire hazard. Making toast takes forever and the walls of this toaster oven are impossible to clean very well. I bought it at Linens and Things.They will not take it back. The approved service center is fifty miles away. Calls to the Delonghi Company are not returned.I am disappointed, furious and without a toaster oven. I see from the other reviews that I am not alone.
__label__2 An entertaining Vampire Film.: An young aspiring B-Movie Tralier Editor (Kerr Smith) driving Cross-Country to be in his sister Wedding but when he picks up mysterious hitch-hiker (Brendan Fehr) and they find themselves battling a bloodsucks vampires (Led by Johnathan Schaech) in the American Southwest.This is a Well Made, Fast-Paced, Action-Thriller is Cleverly Written by Director:J.S. Cardone with also a Surprisngly Good Cast for this Gerne. An small hit in Theaters. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) with an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD Extras are:An Commentary Track by the Director, Deleted Scenes and More. This film will become a Cult Classic for the Horror Gerne. Grade:B+.
__label__1 One of the worst ever: I was laughing at this movie the whole time, and it is not a comedy. I saw it on TV. The only thing good was the song "Blood money".
__label__1 Not The Field Commander....Himself.......: Although,it is very "nice" that other artists appreciate Mr. Cohen, and try to "pay tribute" to his works, it is NOT The Field Commander......Sting does a very commendable job....however, the remainder is just that.....remainder....Cohen's voice may leave some "cold".....but no one can do someone else's poetry as the originator......Cohen does Cohen perfectly.......leave it alone....and for all you who have not had the ultimate privilege of experiencing The Field Commander first hand.....keep away....OR....try to get a video of LC performing live for "Austin City Limits"......you may change your mind......he is absolutely brilliantly sexy....bad voice and all......
__label__2 A Must Have: I found the power of the witch a very excellent book. A must have for anyone Wiccan or thinking of studying, No matter how set or how secure you are in your path you'll find something in the book that will touch your heart.
__label__1 Spreading lies about JFK Jr. and his wife using anonymous so: Spreading lies about JFK Jr. and his wife using anonymous sources.People that think that this was for selling better are in denial.The reason is much more sinister. For some reason the goal of the book is to cover-up the circumstances of his death.The other reason is to diffamate his memory. Does November 2, 2004 ring a bell ?
__label__2 Great to read with a cup of tea.: I loved this book because the author took time to flesh out the main character. The main character is not simply someone who accidently stumbled across a mystery, but someone who cares to know why someone was murdered.The mystery was okay. Not quite an Agatha Christie, but certainly reminiscent of one.This is the second Tea Shop Mystery. I look forward to reading the next one in the series.
__label__1 Don't buy this!: I bought this camera and really liked the way it works and the pictures it takes. However, I have had continuous battery problems with it. I've downloaded firmware and even sent it back to the manufacturer. It takes about 2 pictures and then powers down. It is beyond frustrating especially when you're trying to get a candid shot. I've also had a lot of problems with the candid shots in that you never capture what you think you have because it doesn't respond fast enough.I've even had problems with scanning through the pictures on the camera. This is not a good camera.
__label__1 Animal Tracks of the Southeast States: the sketches are not very crisp and the descriptions are just like those in another book I read;Animal tracks of florida georgia and alabama. the books give tracks for some animals that dont seem to be relevant such as mice and rats. Who wants to track those. Harbor seals in North Georgia. They dont even have turkey tracks in the book. Horses are included like these are even a native species.
__label__1 Poor Design/workmanship on Lid: This was on sale at my local kitchen store in a discontinued color. I almost dropped the lid.just picking it up off the shelf. As it started getting a little crazy by the EH sale table, I failed to notice that the reason why I almost dropped the lid in the shop was because the lip was too shallow and did not sit properly on the bowl. I am naturally a very careful person & break things extremely rarely.Now I just put the lid away and just use the bowl. The bowl itself is nice and you can warm spiced honey or make n' serve maple butter in it but an actual well designed & functioning lid would've been nice.
__label__2 Common's Classic: After listening to this album, you'll probably come to the conclusion that Common is a superb MC. His lyrics and wordplay are amazing; just listen to "Communism" where flips verses with words beginning with "com-" (e.g. "I'm too Com-plex/Watch Com get Com-plicated.."). "I Used To Love H.E.R." is one of the best metaphors ever used in a hip-hop song and tracks like "Sum ... I Wrote" and the title track feature excellent lyrics courtesy of Common and production courtesy of No I.D. and Ynot. If you do not have this album, pick it up now.
__label__2 The More you drink, the Drunker you get: If you were keeping up with the rock scene in the late summer of '73 this album sounded so cool, like nothing you'd ever heard before. "Meadows" was the song I liked the most. They played "Rocky Mountain Way" to death but every once in awhile it still doesn't sound too bad. This whole album is great, check out the end of "Days Gone By". "Happy Ways" has a great bass line and "Midnight Moodies" the only instrumental has some good flute playing. This isn't your typical bass, drums, guitar, vocals rock album. There's alot of extras thrown in and it took me over 2 years to get tired of hearing this album on a fairly regular basis. At one time it was my favorite. I don't have a favorite now but this is still one of them.
__label__1 was excited about getting it..disappionted when i read it: since master of many treasures left me unsure of what had REALLY happened to the heroine i was hoping some of that would be reveiled. i agree with the others that the characters werent well developed (i really only read this book to see what happened to the egg.) i was happy when Ky-Lin was reintroduced cause it was a familiar character like summer and growch were. and cried at the very end because of what happened to the dog :( (im lame arent i) but anyways the book was okay enough just didnt like that she didnt have a direct link to the egg she just happened to be someone who was related to the person that bought it off an auction and was marveling at it.. i wanted someone more caring of the egg or more related to it..book really disappointed me...maybe there will be a next one with ky-lin and the twin hatchling hopefully
__label__2 Adam and Andy Is My Fave: I don't care for superhero comics very much anymore. My favorite comics include HOTHEAD PAISAN HOMICIDAL LESBIAN TERRORIST, CHELSEA BOYS, KYLE'S BED AND BREAKFAST, HEARTS AND IRON and CAVALCADE OF BOYS. But my absolute favorite comic is James Asal's amazing ADAM AND ANDY. It is the warm, sweet and addicting comic strip chronicles of a long term gay couple. Buy it and you will love it too.
__label__2 Not bad: I'm not a big romance novel fan, I read maybe one or two a year. But I picked up this book to take to the beach one afternoon not too long ago and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Most of the time I just skim through romance novels for the "juicy" parts--and then toss them aside when I get home. But this book kept me riveted! I loved the whole gender-bender quality to it. I actually took the book back up to my hotel room and finished reading it in one night. I felt the main hero "Adam" was a bit over done; but I really enjoyed the book. It would have been better if the author could have given a bit more philosophical insight into the effect and impact of breaking some of the gender roles of the time--but hey, it is just a romance novel and a very enjoyable one at that.
__label__2 Overcoming bullying with pride in your heritage: Set along a forgotten lake shore, Muskrat Will Be Swimming is the story of a young girl teased because she is a "lake rat." Her grandfather comes to her rescue by helping her develop pride in her Native American culture. Grandfather weaves the young girl's story into a traditional Native American story focusing on the muskrat. The "Teachers Take Note" webpage for this title on the Tilbury House Publishers website includes add-ons include Native American animal tales art activities as well as internet links to tolerance websites. I received this title complimentary from Tilbury House Publishers in exchange for an honest review, but the opinion is all mine.
__label__2 Braun vs Remington= Remington wins by a long shot: Ive been using Braun 330 and Braun shavers all my life till i went to my dads house and out of curiosity used his. I turned it on and the first thing i noticed was how loud the Remington was but as soon as i started shaving i became an instant Remington fan ever since. I couldn't believe how good it shaved, it only took a few passes and my skin felt like a babies butt except for the neck area but the Braun was the same way but worse.pros= fast shave, close shave, excellent trimmer but read the cons, cordedcons= trimmer is in a weird position and rises somewhat slow, very loud, batteries are permanent
__label__1 So frustrating: I really like the style that Medeiros has shown in the past, but this plot left me cold. I was waiting for an interesting twist as to why the hero was nocturnal. Instead I get the ridiculous scenario I got (no plot revelation despite those of others). I would have liked some warning that this was science fiction. I like historical fiction that makes me feel like I've experienced a different era, not implausible nonsense.
__label__2 Solid, swinging salsa and a singer who can improvise!: Despite all eleven songs being salsa romantica numbers, this is a very solid set full of swinging salsa. The band producer Louis Garcia assembled plays and swings hard (check out "Tendre Que Olvidar", "Santo Remedio", "Ya No Puedo Estar Sin Ti" and "Sin Control" for confirmation). To top it all off, Hector (though no match for the great soneros of yesteryear)can really improvise.This makes him stand out from his salsa romantica contemporaries and demonstrates his talents well.
__label__2 She's smart; he's cautious: I enjoyed this book because of the action and the heroine. She didn't do a brainmelt just because she kissed the hero. She actually makes sensible decisions in tough situations and gives as good as she gets. The setting in the Caribbean is handled realistically without leaving out the local color. There are lots of interesting relationships: friends, lovers, parents and spouses. They are handled well and the characters have some depth. The action is constant and realistic (for an action novel).
__label__1 somewhat amusing and entertaining: If you enjoy reading about an egocentric bass player and his experiences in the music business then this book is for you. I found some of his anecdotes amusing but worthless otherwise. There are a few tips, many of which you can easily get from other musicians you meet on the road (or from a good instructor). Get it if you're curious but if you want to be a better player from this book it's a waste of time.
__label__2 Still relevant research: This is so easy to understand. It also is applicable to many other disabilities. I bought it when first published and lent it to someone. I keep running across the citations, so decided I needded to get another copy for myself.Highly recommended.
__label__1 Does not work on all discs: This item was returned soon after purchase. My wife tried it on the blank cd's we use and it did not work. Apparantly it only works on certain types of discs and we found that to be an inconvienence.
__label__2 Stylish Great Sounds!: JVC again delivers great sounds & style.Testing in typical retail outlets doesn't do justice to the clarity, control, depth, musicality and loudness (without getting ragged in 25 ft x 14 ft room) of this great system, when setup. Details like mini-speaker rubber spikes, and reasonable speaker cable (but have to get co-ax FM aerial yourself) complete the good impression. Downsides- the remote is an ugly grey lump, and I'd have liked a manual-lid-closing as well as button-controlled option. It's not a 'nighclub-thumper' nor up to the quality of a separates system (e.g. NAD/Arcam/Marantz for about 4x the price), but for the money very worthwhile.
__label__2 Strength Training for Women: Love this book. Slim book with color photos. Well organized. Excellent advice for diff stages, about level of person, and what muscle groups to do when.Very impressed with intelligent layout and use of simple tools at home.
__label__2 These Songs for You, Live!: A legend who left this world too soon. Thank goodness his live recordings are being released so that those who love real musical genius & talent can somehow feel that we are there while Donny serenades us.If you have a Donny collection, then some of the songs you already know like: Flying Easy, Someday We'll All Be Free and You've Got A Friend but treats are his covers of Superwoman & Yesterday (and an interview at the end of the disc).I'd highly recommend this disc if you are a serious fan looking to add to your collection AND if you are merely curious about Donny Hathaway, this is a good collection of his songs to begin to familiarize yourself with his music.
__label__1 Very outdated, but not useless today: I read this weak book, here in Brazil.This book was writen before the end of war in Afghanistan.This book talks about the "badal", the pratice to avenge blood for blood, in Afghanistan.This and islamic fanaticism gave will to fight against former Soviet Union, by the Afghans.This book is divided in three parts:1-Afghanistan before the communist coup.2-The coup of april, 1978 and its consequences.3-Soviet invasion and its consequences.This book also has preface, many references,etc.I don't know if I must give three or just two stars, for this book.After thinking a little, I decided to give just two stars for this book.I alsomust tell you, that this book is very outdated today.
__label__1 Free Willy Escape from Pirates Cove: I purchased this movie twice and neither one of the times did the movie download. I have not been able to watch the movie because it doesn't download. I am extremely disappointed as it was a waste of money!!
__label__1 Movie is Terrible: I own a ton of movies, and love any sort of CG movie, but this one is the dumbest movie I that I have ever watched. I'm disappointed that I bought it. But it worked, which says a lot since its a Blu-Ray.
__label__1 Worthless: I have used this product in the past with excellent results, but this must have been a bad batch, for I didn't see any positive results. My dogs were covered in fleas just one week after application, and I was forced to buy locally to resolve the issue. It is difficult to understand how a product can work so well, and then not at all!!!
__label__2 Henry Ribsy: I think that this is a good book because Ribsy gets most of the adventure.from an eight year old:-)
__label__2 AHHHH Can't wait to see more!: I know everyone raves when they talk about a show that they enjoy, and really why would you spend money for a show you weren't into? So it probably comes as no surprise when I say that I love the story line and can't wait to see what happens next season. I won't give away any spoilers so I'll stop now. But if you are into a little bit of drama and strongly believe that families should stick together you will enjoy this show.
__label__1 Short cord.: I bought it in hopes of using it with a regular Mac. The USB cord was too short, and because it wasn't one that could be replaced with a longer one, I needed to return it.
__label__2 the way organizations should be run: This is an excellent book detailing a system that is philosophically, theoretically, and methodologically sound. It details common problems in organizations, examines the practices that maintain these problems, and offers a system by which they may be addressed. The only trouble with it is that it wasn't proofread that well and, as a result, may at times cause confustion with the reader.
__label__2 Action packed: Fun mvie to watch if you are into Sci-Fi along with the military application component of the movie. Special effects are cool along with an interesting story line. I found myself renting it several times, realizing that I should buy it instead.
__label__1 Don't purchase this bed!!!: I purchased this bed only to find that the bolts provided are too short. I should have known something was up when the first thing I saw on the instructions were the words "if something is wrong, don't return the bed to the store, email or call us at..." Well, I emailed and explained the situation (which I'm sure they were well aware of already) and I received a prompt response stating that the new nuts and bolts would be sent to me within two weeks (that's right, two weeks to rectify a situation they are well aware of). Well, it's been nearly three weeks and still no nuts and bolts. Now I have to repackage the thing and haul it back to the store. What a pain!!!!
__label__1 Stressful!: Well, I opened the front door, threw the entire coffeemaker out the door and watched it smash all over the front sidewalk!!!!! IT felt great too! I have had this since September. Since then the grind drawer has popped open no less than four times during brewing and flooded the counter. You cannot use this machine unless all SIX annoying pieces are in place. Hard to see how much water you have poured and this past weekend I did not have the carafe lid on tight and the entire pot of hot coffee spilled all over the counter, floor, and new rug. Out the door it went! I hated this thing from day one. Don't know what I'll do if a bigger appliance breaks?
__label__2 exactly right: Of the many reunited bands that made great "comeback" albums in 2003 (Wire, Killing Joke, others that I'm probably forgetting), "What Is Real and What Is Not" is the most surprising - it's an absolutely perfect follow-up to the classic self-titled 100 Flowers album of 1983. Listening to "What Is Real...", it's hard to believe that 20 years have passed since 100 Flowers last recorded.The songs here are short, to the point, and at the same time edgy and wickedly melodic. There really is not a weak song in the bunch - even the cover of the (pre-disco crap) Bee Gees "Jumbo" fits perfectly.I wouldn't change a note. This album is damn near perfect. I just hope that we won't have to wait another 20 years for another!
__label__2 Dragon Bones: I've read all of her books & believe this one is very good, but it does drag a bit in some areas. The reader does become aware of China's fight to keep it's relics. Well written with lots of good information.
__label__1 For Your Consideration: I don't like that the movie has the words "For Your Consideration" at the bottom of the screen for much of the movie. You should have mentioned this in your description.
__label__2 Lots of new information!: I was taught the dominate hand method of playing zils, but found everyone I asked who was really good and really fast with zils played with both hands. I now play ambidextrously but have a hard time explaining the concept to my beginner zil students. This DVD has given me some enciteful ideas to help me with my zilling. There were a few things that were a little confusing, I had never heard of "Balady Triples" and finally figured out she meant "Triples" or what we sometimes call a "gallop".Also when Elsa does her exercise switching between "Balady Triples" and "Basic" it would be helpful if she did it once slow and counting, since for many the 123 1 123 1 123 pattern is a new concept. I was taught Beledi aka Masmoudi Seghir a little differently from this. Otherwise, this would have been a 5 star DVD. I always enjoy World Dance New York products and find them a great value for the money.
__label__1 Worse than useless book: After traveling from Texas, we used this book to select a quick 2 mile hike on our first day in Colorado,. Upon getting started on the hike, we realized that the author's idea of an easy hike was way off base. The hike had 500 feet of elevation gain per mile and was way to steep to enjoy with our dogs on leashes (especially downhill). Later we researched the hike with another author and found the hike graded as strenuous. A local hiker asked us on our hike why we picked the such a steep trail for our initial hike. We will not use the Best Hikes with Dogs Colorado again. We will do our own research and calculate the elevation change ourselves.If you are an advanced mountain hiker and work with your dog off leash frequently, this book will probably work for you. If you are a flatlander and come to Colorado for its wonderful mountains, the hikes selected in this book are probably too aggressive for hiking with your dog.
__label__2 Excellent quality: The cover is perfect for scratch protection in a bookbag with other items. The zipper is well designed to prevent contact with the laptop. Not meant for impact protection. I do wish the outer cover was pure black. It has MB 13.3" written in big white letters over one side and the company logo on the other.
__label__2 Great holiday tablecloth at a fair price: Not a bad tablecloth for the Xmas season. The holly in the tablecloth is not too subtle, and not too pronounced. Not bad for $15 dollars. If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive tablecloth for the holidays or for that Xmas party, this might be the right one for you.
__label__1 Without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read: This book is absymal. There is no other way to put it. It boggles the mind to think that this text ever made it print. The concepts in DiffEq are really not that hard, but this book cannot even explain simple concepts elequently -- and I am a Math major.If you are Math faculty member that has any decision making powers, I strongly urge you to choose ANY other book. Choosing this book for your DiffEq class will devalue the quality of education provided by your University. IT IS THAT BAD.
__label__1 Formatting Review: I'm giving Travels w/ Charley two stars because at least there aren't any typos, and there are very few hyphenated words appearing in the middle of sentences.The problem with TWC is that all the white space between text sections has been removed (rather, overlooked), but the non-indent of the new opening paragraph remains. What that means for the reader is confusion as the chapters are a collection of non sequiturs.Conclusion: Sloppy (even contemptuous) text to Kindle conversion.
__label__1 Bought it for the wife: Unfortunately she did not like the book. The subject matter is right up her alley, but apparently it was too bland and just not engaging enough.
__label__1 I do not like this video: I checked this movie from my local library to see if it would be of good use for my school. The video is very vague of the history and accomplishments of the Latino community and more about bashing the United States. It is a veiled attempt of Latinos to not become a part of the United States people nor culture. Videos and books like this give rise to fears of many Americans that the Mexican Immigrant does not want to become a Citizen of the States, and has more loyalty to his cultural homeland. Written and directed like it was from La Raza and not a mainstream Latino group.I highly dislike this movie, it's overall statements and it fails to meet the objectives in the title. Instead of creating individuals proud of being Latino, it makes them feel a victim of history. Bad presentation also.
__label__2 Good Product: The machine works well for our tile floors. I would recommend it for any type of hard surface floors.
__label__1 Not Even Worth It: I went to a church with a friend of mine on Sunday and the pastor of the church preached about this book and how it refered to God. The Pastor said that he trust God and God alone. I agree with him. There is only one God and he sees and knows all. Everyone who thinks that there a little God's running around here they are going to hell. How could someone write a book like this. It just makes me sick. Don't waste your money on this book......
__label__1 Amster-Amster-dam-dam-dam: Ian McEwan's small comedy is about as engaging and carefully constructed as the campfire song. The humor is thin, forced, and entirely dependent on schadenfreude. The plot follows the mutual self-destruction of two members of the British intellectual class, an accidental editor and a pre-modern composer. But really the demise of any of the other characters - all equally conventional, egotistical, and empty-headed - would be equally entertaining. Fortunately, the book is short and the vocabulary is shallow, so the reading experience is mercifully quick.
__label__2 Total Gem: Like another reviewer did, I pulled this off a dusty shelf and listened to it again recently ... and was blown away all over again. This is a total gem of an album. Great songs, great performance and singing by Steve. That emotional thump that makes good albums rise to greatness. This one has it all. As others have noted, Steve Earle is amazingly consistent and has released loads of great music over the past three decades. He is one of America's true musical treasures, yet he still doesn't get the respect he deserves. If you have enjoyed any of Steve Earle's music and somehow missed hearing this album, don't put it off any longer. You NEED to have this one too.
__label__2 Weeds here I come.: Look all over the find it other places, didn't want to purchasea new weed wacker, ordered it works fine
__label__1 Broken right out of the box: At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in. After a few tries some of the teeth stuck and will not come back out. Cheaply made- I won't be buying another one.
__label__2 If you can recite the scientific statement of being...: ... then you were raised in Christian Science and may be struggling to make sense of your experience. Read this book. If you love someone who is a lapsed Christian Scientist, read this book. Wilson lends historical perspective and emotional insight as she lovingly and thoughtfully articulates that peculiar childhood. I found her explanations thought-provoking, tremendously helpful and well-written.
__label__1 Writing Style and chracter development could be better: Letter of the Law started with a good premise, but the author's style made it not live up to its potential. Each chapter included multiple voices of charcters and provided insight into the thought of each chracter. Because of this, the book was not very suspensful, with a couple of exceptions. The killer in this novel was also not presented as diabolical as he could have been and therefore did not add that much to the suspense. I especially did not like the mentality the author gave for why the killer was doing what he did. It was very unbelieveable and should have been in an x-files episode. Any person who is seasoned in reading legal thrillers and other suspense novels will be disappointed in the simpleness of this novel.
__label__1 Shameful Tribute: I got word of this cd through word of mouth and had to buy it simply because I've been a Duranie since 1982. I figured it would be something spectacular, hoping for something comparably synonomous with the Carole King tribute cd several years back. The only song covered on this cd that is worth mentioning is the "Save A Prayer" remake by Eve's Plum (beatiful and haunting). The rest? Well, Those other "bands" tried way to hard or not hard enough... If I were an original Fab Five member, I'd be insulted.
__label__1 Pretty paperweights. Useless "highlighting".: When they did work, they highlighted (blacked out!) WAY TOO DARK so you could barely read the text through the darker colors (purple, I had one pack w/a blue in it, etc). Then they dried out COMPLETELY after just a few weeks of extremely minimal use.Who ever thought you'd need to read a review about a highlighter!?These suck.
__label__2 A must-have for those into kooky art projects: Some years ago I stumbled upon this book and quickly made the creation of a Screamer my main project for an art class I was taking...that Screamer is now one of my favorite artifacts and has a special place on my shelf. Anyone looking to make something basically goofy with room for lots of personal touches should look into this one. A few of the instructions were a bit hard to follow, but even if you wing it you should make it through okay.
__label__1 the rhythms were offbeat: I seem to be at odds with most of the other reviewers who thought the book started slow and later picked up speed. I personally was rather intrigued with the beginning and very interested in Cora's story. I agree with the Publisher's Weekly review that it could have been a great characterization of Cora and her struggles, but it passed over many years to start the story of Emma and quickly became uneven and full of holes. The part of Parris was so short and uninteresting compared to the other two that I believe even Ms. Hill grew bored with her rambling story and just wanted to hurry up and finish it. For a more well-written (minus the empty fluff) generational story of mothers and daughters, read Cane River by Lalita Tademy or the Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan
__label__2 Fab!: If you're a fan you need know no more. It was perfect. "Laugh out loud" funny. I want to write more but it would spoil the fun for those who have yet to see this episode.It's a treasure.
__label__2 great camera: It's really a great camera. So small you take it anywhere. The only complaint I have is red eye. Even with the red eye reduction flash, lots of pics still come out with red eyes!
__label__2 Beautiful Visions: I am not Catholic, but became interested in Mary after observing in society, and within my own heart, a longing for the divine feminine. The vivid accounts of her visitations around the world and the beautiful artwork are both fascinating and comforting. This gorgeous volume is a feast for the eyes as well as the soul.
__label__2 Adorable Ring: I just love this ring! I wear it on my left thumb and because it is somewhat adjustable, it fits really well and doesn't slide off. I get many compliments. It is very nice quality and I think it is prettier than the picture. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 I agree with whoever said "painfully unfunny.": I'm still a Steve Martin fan, but I'm amazed that he could make something this lousy. A weak story, with weak attempts at humor.I agree with the other negative comments about this one.A very talented guy who made a turkey, I'd say.
__label__2 this filter is a great deal!: This is a super filter for the price!! It is easy to use, easy to clean and replace filter cartridges. I would definately purchase one again for another tank I have.
__label__1 More LIke "Naked Ending": The first book of the series got me interested enough to read the rest, and although I had problems with many aspects of the story, I kept reading, hoping that the ending would make it worthwhile. I was warned about the ending by a cousin, but I kept on, hoping that he was just being too critical. He was not. The bad guys were really bad, which is good, but the good guys were not particularly good. It was very difficult to like any character much past his or her introduction, as they all tended to shed any morals they had at the first opportunity. The expectation was that the ending would point them in the right direction, but instead we got the wave of a magic wand, and everything's okay, even though no one deserves it.The shame of it is that the effort, the scope, and many of the ideas were impressive. A touch of decency would have gone a long way.
__label__1 Doesn't fit: It's the same filter as the old one,EXCEPT, the plastic base is bigger. The plastic filter lock won't fit into the vacuum like it should.
__label__2 One Of My Very Favorite Movies!: I LOVE this movie. It was the first vdeo I ever bought for myself and is one of the sweetest, most romantic, and funniest movies I've seen. DB Sweeney is gorgeous as the loveable, girl chasing,less than brilliant ex-hockey god, and Moira Kelly plays an excellent, evil, spoiled typical rich primadonna figure skater from Connecticut. Techncally, it is hard to believe a hockey player could be transformed into a figure skater, but view it with an open mind and you will fall in love with this movie too!
__label__1 Pathetic: I expected a high energy DVD/CD that could be used to first to watch, and later as music/instructions for a hearty water workout. This is a slow workout, instructions translated (poorly) from a foreign language, with soft unenergizing background music. I should have returned it.
__label__2 true rap: Isaac Hayes selections on this cd are similiar to a mini movieor love story. Ike's Rap leading into Our day will come get thecd off to a great start. The pace and the story continue througheach selection. This cd gives you true rap and you can wind yourself into the rap because most of us have been there. Isaac wasnever given enough credit for introducing modern rap in thelate 60's and 70's. This is a very satisfying cd.
__label__2 Silicone Gun Cloth: I purchased this silicone cloth in order to wipe down handguns. Many years ago I purchased a similar product and it was finally time to replace it. The Outers Silicone Gun & Reel cloth are a superb buy for the money. The cloths are soft and will not scratch the surface you are using them on. They have a pleasant silicone smell and do exactly what they are prescribed to do....remove oils; fingerprints; and, dirt leaving no residue. The silicone contained in the cloth will protect the metal surface of your handgun. The 17 x 17 size is standard. In reviewing the various products on the market, I found these cloths to be the best buy for the money. I bought several of them.They are easily foldable and can easily be carried in your range bag. I carry one in a resealable plastic sandwich bag. It's there when you need it and will last for years.
__label__2 Great book!: This book is very well written and easy to understand. It gives many examples and is divided into acceptable chapters! Good purchase for counselors who wish to do group counseling.
__label__2 A great grinder without another whole appliance: We have had the grinder for 10+ years now. Since we aren't on a farm or hunters we aren't grinding meat regularly but it does the job.The only con I would offer is that the "tray" that hold product waiting to be ground should be larger. Kitchenaid now sells an add on that increases this capacity
__label__1 Inept Attempt at History: The author is neither a historian nor a terrorism expert and it shows. Myth and fact are presented equally; a result of the author's insufficient knowledge of the topic to determine which is which. Appears to be an attempt to capitalize on the interest in terrorism occuring since 9-11. I gave it a 1 becuase 0 was not available.
__label__2 I miss my friend: Country music always gets to the core of a listeners heart. I get chocked up when I listen to country songs that come from the heart, with a story to tell. But got so emotional when I listened to "I miss my friend" that I cried there was'nt enough kleenex left when it was over. Any one with a true love, can relate to the emotional message in this song.
__label__1 Simply Scandalous!: I was outraged by this book. By the time I got to the entry "humpy", I should have realized this book was not for me. I had to put the book down, my hands were shaking so badly. I am still in shock over all the countless references to (I can hardly bare to even write the words): sex-linkage! In addition to being scandalous, the book was not even helpful. I plunked down a lot of money for this book, and most of it was just a bunch of descriptions. For instance the section entitled "Deficiencies": all descriptive, without one word about what to DO about all those deficiences. The section "Departures from Diploidy", while having a fetchy alliterative title, suffered the same problem. The only thing I liked about this book was its pretty red cover.
__label__2 Amazing Solti!: A "Mahlervelous" recording this. Every stop is out. Solti's conducting is electric and the soloists of the highest calibre- Minton and Popp's vocal talents are rich and warm but never too intrusive and blend in superbly with the music. Solti's pace is a little on the brisque side but this only adds to the overall sense of occasion and greatness of the piece. A worthy entry into this mammoth symphony. When compared with other versions Solti holds his own admirably with this electric perfromance- not as warm a sound as Tennstedt's but more wide ranging, dynamic and rich. Buy, switch off the lights and prepare yourself for an experience.
__label__1 Self-indulgent and irrelevant: This movie is SO over-rated. This movie is pointless and boring.I swear, every time a movie is 150 minutes, it should ALWAYS be 45 minutesshorter. There is so much schlock footage, just wasting screen time.Ok, so three different stories about communication problems. WHO CARES?!?!The movie had no intrigue, intellectual stimulation, or emotional pull.This movie is flat out dull. Don't waste your time, I beg of you.
__label__1 My dog loved the beef flavor but not the peanut butter: These sticks don't smell like peanut butter at all, so my dog didn't like them... though she goes absolutely gaga over real peanut butter. Also these sticks are much softer than the beef flavor, which my dog likes. After begrudgingly eating a couple of these, she barfed, and has not wanted them since. If you need to buy this, go for the beef flavor!!
__label__2 Love Ello!!: I bought a set of ello for my five-and-a-half year old because I love what legos has done for my son. Ello has inspired creativity and imagination in my daughter and her friends. They tell me ello is very fun to play with, and love to build people and flowers. There are many small pieces, but she seems to have no trouble manipulating them, and we store them in a ziplock bag. A great rainy day activity!
__label__1 Broken In Box... TWICE!!! But...: I waited 3 months for this item to be in stock. I got it in the mail and it was broken. I went to Babies R Us to buy another (since I couldn't return my broken one to the store) and they didn't have the mocha in stock. I ended up buying another pattern thinking I could use the part from the new one that wasn't broken. Low and behold when I got it home and opened the box, it was broken too, in the same spot. I finally got a hold to someone at Graco (they have bankers hours) and they mailed me another one. I received it about 2 weeks later. And it's great!
__label__1 Awful movie: Other people rated this movie highly. What were they drinking or smoking? My wife and I agree, this movie should be avoided. It should never have been made.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY TOASTMASTER PRODUCTS: I recently owned two Toastmaster products and both are now in the local landfill. One broke after 4 months, 4-slice toaster,and is not covered under any warranty. One of the darkness knobs popped out and the darkness is uncontrollable??? Toastmaster ignored all emails sent to them about this one.Their griddle product is horrible. After approxiamately 6 uses,the griddle began cooking uneven. They acknowledged one of my emails but never followed through. It tooks 60 days of my time for nothing.STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. THIER LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTIES ARE JUST PROMISES.
__label__1 God, This Movie's A Monster!: Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. Who cares about an ageing homosexual who lusts after his hunky, straight gardener? I didn't care about the characters, and found them to be extremely annoying....especially Redgrave. What was she trying to mumble all the way through the film....who really cares? What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what? If you run out of sleeping tablets one night, hire this sleep-inducing movie.
__label__2 this album rocks socks~!!: I've been waiting for Ashlee's CD since I read somewhere that she was beginning to record it. I absolutely LOVE her CD~!! I've gotten like, 8 of my friends to purchase the album and we've all agreed that our favorite song was "Shadow". All the songs on the album are absolutely wonderful, but Shadow definitely stands out...to me anyway. Cop the album...it's sOo worth it.
__label__1 Cheap, thin metal - tube insert very warped: The first thing I noticed when I got this pan home was that the tube insert was extremely warped. It was just shoddy workmanship and certainly showed little to no quality control. I also was surprised at how thin the metal was. It just looked and felt cheap. I hoped that wouldn't matter when baking a cake in it. After all, I told myself, Wilton is a well-known brand.After removing the cake from the pan, I saw that my concern about the warped insert was justified. The whole cake was tilted or crooked -- not something you'd want to serve to guests. After frosting it, it looked even more crooked.And when cleaning up the pan, I found that it was very scratched up after only one use. That was enough to convince me that I would be returning this pan.
__label__2 Worth it: It was a little corny at times but I thought generally it was a good movie. I would defiantly recommend it.
__label__1 Worn out stock shocks better, no joke: Well I fell for it, bought a set of Rancho shocks during their "shockoctober", buy 3 get 1 free after rebate deal. Installed on a 2004 Suburan 1500, 4WD, LT, no lift. These shocks are terrible, no control, dampening, body roll is much worse, doesn't do what a shock absorber is supposed to do. It feels like there isn't a shock installed. My worn out original AC delco shocks with 135,000 miles on them, were much better. The rest of my suspension is in good condition, I assure you I am not exaggerating one bit. If I didn't throw away the shocks I removed, I would have put them back on, and tried to return the new ones Rancho ones. I should have went with I know works well, Bilstein or Monroes.Save your money up for some AC Delcos, Monroes or Bilsteins or anything else but these. I'm completely serious I can't say enough how terrible these shocks are.
__label__1 Too bad, but this didn't work for me: I have a lot of pain when I get my bikini and underarms sugared, and I was excited to try this product. Unfortunately, it did not minimize my pain at all. I applied it an hour before my appointment, and even put extra on about 30 minutes before...oh well.
__label__2 Philly Has Done It Again: Philly has some talented writers, and Anna J is one of the top authors from this area. My Woman His Wife was told with such energy that it makes me wonder if the author is telling her life story. I was mad that it ended so soon, and I can't wait for the sequel to hit the shelves. This story was so fast paced I had to get my head together after reading it.THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!! Good job, Anna J. Well done!
__label__1 Very Disappointing: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I first watched it when I was younger on VHS and it had subtitles for everything. On this DVD, there are only subtitles for the spoken words, and not for the music and songs! Those are what keep the story moving along, and in this DVD you have no idea what the two lovers are saying to each other. I am very mad and upset about this. I would love to find this DVD with subtitles on EVERYTHING!
__label__1 cheap quality: I thought I was getting a good quality product with Calphalon but what a disappointment. It is a poor design made with poor materials. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
__label__2 TO ME THE BEST MADONNA CD: THERE SHE GOES, THIS ALBUM WAS THE MOST IMPRESSING AND FRESH CD OF MADONNA EVER. I LOVE THESE SONGS SINCE I WAS A KID.LOVE IT!!! THAT'S THE MADONNA I WANNA KEEP IN MIND.DANCE!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 very original: This is a very interesting and original horror. A very talented Jennifer Connelly has a very strange gift of communicating with insects and is the outcast of a girl's school where even the teachers are cruel to her and think she is mental. There is a killer on the loose and via telepathic communication with the insects is able to track down the killer, or will she be the next victim?
__label__1 What a waste of time: This book is terrible -- I almost did not finish it because, you know, you never get that time back after you've wasted it. The lead male character is a pompous, smarmy, womanizing crook/attorney whom the author apparently believes you will learn to like. The lead female character is a lesbian (not that there is anything wrong with that) who becomes confused about her sexuality when she is inexplicably drawn to the creepy, crook/attorney. While the topic of an investigation into lawyers bribing judges is interesting, the book never builds up any suspense. In fact, you could say that there is an utter absence of plot. I enjoyed Presumed Innocent, but found this book to be a complete disappointment.
__label__1 ooooooooooooooooooooooooooook then...: Movies, music, photos, and games. Who cares?? Dead pixels. Everyone cares. Forget nintendo, it has ups and downs, but do NOT comapare PSP and NDS. PSP sux. NDS... is...huh. Who am I kidding? Both systems suck!!! Get a laptop.
__label__2 Nailed It!: The guys a documentary genius. I don't like some of the ambush tactics he uses in his films, but never-the-less, he's usually dead on. Those who love him and those who hate him can argue all day long, but he's yet to lose a libel suit. If you haven't seen this film before, or since the war started, check out a copy. It's more on the mark today in reflection than it even was during it's release. Too bad the news is so controlled today, otherwise they'd be running Bush out of town for all the lies and damage he's done to this country and it's security. Of course if you are one of the 17% remaining with W's on your car that are still looking under rocks for WMD and think that W can walk on water, than this one is not for you, or your blook pressure. Check out Sicko while you are at it. Everyone can agree what a mess our health care is, and Sicko will make you sick at how Washington does nothing while people suffer.
__label__1 Save your money and don't waste your time!: I can't believe that anyone would give this book 5 stars. I could only stomach a few chapters. The main character was selfish, annoying, and completely unrelatable. Don't buy this book!
__label__1 good product poor shipping: This is very good glue but it came via the post office and now that they fly all small packages the lids had been pushed up by the low air pressure and leaked on the 2 that I had purchased. I do not think there is any way around this but strapping tape over the lid might help. Try to find it locally if you can.
__label__2 An excellent game in need of an excellent master.: When I first bought this game, I thought it would be a breeze, like Link's Awakening was after I got the hang of it. I was wrong. It was simple, yet at the same time, it was so complex, it was addictive. With a few fun mini-games and hundreds of challenges, this is definitely a game for those who want a challenge. I beat the game to find out that certain people want passwords. To gain access to these passwords, you need to beat Oracle of Seasons. If you insert these passwords into Ages, you get special weapons, special rings (which give you special powers), etc. The game is easy enough for a child to play, and hard enough for a master to get stuck. Interested? Then I have 3 words for you : BUY THE GAME!
__label__2 Great Movie: With all the movies out there this one is great for the entire family. We enjoyed it a lot and didn't have to worry about foul language which is a plus in these days.
__label__1 Where's the magic?: We all love this group of musicmakers.However, before you buy this King Crimson CD do your homework and review which "members" took part in making Construcktion of Light...
__label__2 Great little wok: For the price this is a great little wok. We have used it several times and the non-stick works great.
__label__2 Looking for the last 4-5 episodes: I am desperatly trying to find the last 4-5 episodes...the ones where Gabriel has Catherine and Vincent is trying to find her and their son. If anyone has access to these, I'm willing to pay...this was some of the best stuff on television...ever!
__label__1 It's a Fake.: When I bought this, I thought I'd be getting a good deal on a REAL Chi, because my REAL Chi broke after 3 years.But this one works just as well as the drugstore ones.It takes forever to heat up, it doesn't even get that hot, and the Chi words are coming off on both sides, as well as the "Global Beauty" words.DON'T BUY. Just spend a little more money on the real deal.
__label__2 Wonderful music!: It's great to hear Jack Wagner again. In the 80's I had the cassette tapes and over the years they've disappeared. I was so happy to find this album on CD. It has some lovely memories for me, and it's hard to not sing along with it. I worried some about how it would sound being put onto CD, but I am very pleased with it. Definately worth every penny, and I hope the other's are re-released to CD soon!
__label__2 jawboned: I love this product but i'm told there is an echo on the receiving end. I havn't found a single headset that doesn't have this problem. Otherwise it works well.
__label__1 pretentious dreck: I watched this movie based on recommendations, and i hated it. It was supposed to be about someone who cannot make new memories, but nothing in the film really seemed to be about that. it was more just a repetitive series of flashbacks, each of which disclosed another bit of a dumb story. don't bother
__label__1 What a piece of JUNK!!!: STAY AWAY FROM THIS VACUUM. Electrolux took the perfectly good Eureka Oxygen and found a way to sell them at half the price by substituting cheap parts. I owned the original Eureka oxygen for 5 years and it was fantastic. I then decided to use that one for my basment and get the new one for our main floor. BAD MOVE. I've got wires burning up, and handles that quit working after a whopping 2 months of use. I'm throwing it in the garbage now and buying a $100.00 Hoover.
__label__2 most important book i've ever read: This book will change your life. If you love America, but hate the way our government gets away with murder, this is for you.
__label__2 Case fits nice on Garmin: The carrying case for my Garmin fits well and give that extra security of not scratching the screem.
__label__2 Great for high school teachers: As a teacher interested in theory and practice of character education, I was amazed at the great ideas that this book offers as well as intriguing ideas about what's really important in teaching. It's the heart of the teacher that really matters. This book has deepened and inspired my work. Very different from other, more superficial treatments of character development. NOT dumb or corny! Thanks.
__label__2 Good stuff... for a guy who can't write.: If you haven't read the book yet, let me lay your suspicions to rest... Henry Rollins is indeed illiterate. But! That fact does nothing to repress the raw energy bursting from every page of this book. This is the stuff. True accounts from the front lines. The first two chapters are basically just Rollins telling stories from Black Flag. The rest of the book is journal entries, and my only complaint is that Henry comes off as retarded when he tries to play the hardcore intellectual. This book is excellent as an anthropological record, not as a literary feat. It's a coffee table book for degenerates. (Man is there a lot of good juicy violence in here! Rollins gets his ( ) kicked like 500 times!) Good stuff.
__label__1 She used the R word. Twice. And in a bad way.: I've been struggling recently with finding proper care for my son with cognitive disabilities, and got this book as an "unwind". Sadly she chose to use the word "ret**ded" several times and WOW that is so not cool.:(
__label__2 I cannot believe this title is unavailable: I visit Spain often. I love the culture, the people, even sometimes the food. They have a fantastic musical tradition. Unfortunately, most contemporary artists make a mess of the Spanish musical past. Morente is a happy exception to the rule, and OMEGA is a masterpiece. This is as good as contemporary Spanish music gets--at least as far as I know. Indeed, this is just about my favorite CD. For a deeply satisfying mix of flamenco, rock, jazz, and just plain good music, search out and find this CD. Morente is an artist. He knows what he's doing. And to top it all off, he's doing it with the poetry of Federico Garcia Lorca. Many try to work with Lorca's lyrics. Few succeed in matching their power. Morente comes as close as any. Listen.
__label__1 Don't Buy: The Seller don't stand behind their product. I have a 4 year old boy that used it 2 days maybe about 1 hour max.The rope that holds it broke while he was hitting it. He Never hung on it, I was there the whole time, and we spent alot of money on this. After I bought this on Amazon I saw it for cheaper in the store and now I wish I would have done just that. Stores reimburse you for products that don't work. You should stand behind a product that don't work too. My advise is don't buy this because if anything goes wrong they don't stand behind there products.
__label__1 I am just appalled that anybody likes this book: This has got to be one of the most unfunny books I have ever read. I am just appalled to think that there are women out there who are actually taking this advice. The utter disrespect this woman expresses for her family and herself is astounding. If this somehow represents a recognizable American family experience, even as a satire, all I can say is there is something dreadfully wrong in a lot of people's lives.
__label__1 Ehm...what the hell?!: This is the sort of movie where if you go "nah, didn't really like it" people will just say that you didn't get it as if you're some sort of moron, who's incapable of comprehending a movie with a more complex plot than Star Wars. The movie does have a couple of upsides (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) namely Michael Palin and the stunning visuals. The rest is dismal at best. The movie is way too long and I felt no connection to the characters whatsoever. I also don't think that Gilliam is some sort of visionary for creating this movie...does the # "1984" ring a bell? Now that was a visionary book while this is a halfhearted attempt to copy it (along with some personal additions here and there).And don't be fooled by people telling you that it's a black comedy either. There are some midly amusing scenes in it, most of them involving Michael Palin in one way or another, but even those don't deserve much more than a casual smile.
__label__1 WHAT A JOKE: Leatherman 830040 New Wave Multi-Tool with Nylon SheathI have owned various Letherman multitools for years & this one is the worst one yet, first the nylon sheath wears lousey, will not stay closed, every time I use the toilet the tool falls out, that little scrawney worthless screwdriver broke off on the second use, the wire cutter don't hold up, bends stranded copper wire instead of cutting it, after use closing the tool is a difficult task,the plier part locks up & must be pried apart to close,the standard cutting blade hold an edge & becomes useless, the phillip & straight screwdriver insert wears out too fast (cheap metal), LM discontinued an excellent multitool & replaced it with this piece of junk, shame on you Leatherman, you just lost a good customer
__label__1 The Mozart Season: The Mozart Season is about a girl named Allegra and her determination to go to the finals of the Ernast Bloch violin competition. Allegra has playd the violin for a very long time and she is very good at it. Allegra's mother and father play the cello for an orchestra. Allegra's violin teacher, Mr. Kaplan is a very interesting character, he has a pillow that says "A teacher is someone that makes yo believe you can do it.Although Virginia Wolff has a point, which is that practice makes perfect. This book is not one of my favorites. I didn't like it because it was a very slow moving book and if you like action books this is not the book for you. But until the end keep your mind open and then you can make your own opinion.~ Ellie
__label__1 The words may change, but the beat remains the same: After listening to this CD,I was left wondering why every musical arrangement sounded the same. The lyrics changed, but the beat remained the same from one song to the next. As a Cher fan, I am extremely dissapointed in this product.
__label__1 Don't waste your money on this one: We broke our last monitor, went looking for the least expensive one and ended up with this. The sound quality is awful. The base unit sits over my son's bed, but it still sounds like he's in a tunnel. Second, it does not have rechargeable batteries and eats up 9 volt batteries like nobody's business. This one's cheap (until you add the cost of batteries), and you'll certainly get what you pay for! My advice: Spend a little more and make sure it uses rechargeable batteries.
__label__1 Not compatible: This is sold as a "frequently sold with" the V500. They are not compatible. Wasted too much time and energy on this one.
__label__2 Amazing Movie: I love this movie and think that everyone should watch it! The plot is engaging and the characters are interesting. Thanks Pixar and Disney!
__label__2 Greatness: There are not enough words to describe this album or artist. When music is watered down to fit the mood of the masses, this is a breath of fresh air or maybe I should say that it is food to those who have been straving for good soul serching music. And search is what this album will cause you to do, the song provoke thought.
__label__2 Very funny and very sweet: I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and this is one of my favorite. I received this movie as a graduation gift and I really like it. Hugh Grants George character was such a pain in the butt to Sandra Bullock's Lucy character but he grew on her.Lucy was always an overachieving, take charge, and want to make a difference person while George was guy who never really needed to work hard just represent his company.
__label__1 Does not fit receiver as advertised: The advert says the product is compatible with 1-1/4" and 2" receivers. That is not true. It works only with a 2" receiver. Unfortunately I do not have that. In addition the box itself has several chips in the coating. All in all a very disappointing experience. Not recommended.
__label__2 Great for toddlers, but ...: We love this booster seat for our 14 month old son. It is snug fitting to our chairs and easy to clean. My only compliant is the removable dishwasher safe tray. It is too easy to remove, and my son after one day of use, figured out how to remove it and throw his meal all over the floor. We just put that piece away, and use the regular tray all the time. I think that if we have another baby, I would skip the high chair all together and use this from the start.
__label__2 Tiger Tail: Excellent product.Very helpful with sore and knotty muscles.Strongly recommend.The soft cover is the difference.
__label__2 Fantasy and Magic, a Perfect Combination: Haven of Lost Souls is a great book for anyone interested in the fantasy genre or is just getting started. The main characters, once royalty are now fighters on the side of justice. The troubles they go through for the city when they come across a crisis seem always to be on a large scale, and their thinking always brings them out on top. Action also is rampant in this book giving those with a scent for blood plenty for their senses. Overall this book provides plenty of entertainment, with murder, death, and suspense at every turn.
__label__2 Excellent Read, Challenging Story: The "fictional" book does an excellent job of challenging you in the real world. The great part is it is so well written you will find it hard to put it down to the very end.
__label__2 Great price for very acceptable product: I generally refill my own cartridges, but I mainly wanted some EXTRA physical cartridges for refill, especially after I screwed up one of my original cartridges with the wrong color (must have been really tired that day). The performance of the new cartridges has been more than satisfactory for the price. From what I have read, one of the big differences between ink quality is longevity, so I will worry about that when the time comes. I've got a lot of confidence in products purchased through Amazon, and reading reviews helps a lot. That's why I try to review the items I buy, doing my bit to help other consumers.
__label__2 dont like it: it is a good product but i do not like the bulkiness and it is an eye sore.. but it does work effectively.
__label__2 What a tear-jerker!: I absolutely loved this book. It was quite a tear-jerker. I liked the flashback to Sierra's relative. Readers will enjoy Francine Rivers' writing style and effective use of imagery. I couldn't put this book down!
__label__2 Informative, Intuitive, and Very Applicable: The authors do an excellent job of applying modern game theory principles to past and current business strategies. Co-opetition provides useful tools for dealing in the competitive business environment. The book was easy to read and flowed logically.
__label__2 Basketball team win championship after learning teamwork.: In These Girls Hope is a Muscle, is a special book for all ages and sexes. The story of a girls basketball team warms the heart with the high hope of determination. The book proves if you put your mind to something you can go all the way. The lives of the eleven girls are explained in detail and is boring towards the beginning,but towards the middle, this upbeat book becomes wonderful to read. The book has a good moral and a great theme. I also enjoyed how Jen and Jamila gave realistic vibes!
__label__1 Good vacuum, terrible shipping: This vacuum probably works fine if you buy it in a store. The problem is the manufacturer's box is too flimsy for UPS delivery. The vacuum has many thin plastic parts. The first one arrived broken. I asked for a replacement and it also arrived broken and the box is so smashed up that I need to buy a new box to put it in before I can ship it back. It costs the same amount in most stores so there is no reason to buy this from Amazon.
__label__2 Now 7 Review: I really liked this CD because of all the great songs on it. I never heard some of the songs, such as the ones by Samantha Mumba, 3LW, Mystikal, and R. Kelly, but they were pretty good. I think the Neptunes Remix of Backstreet Boys - The Call was good, and made the song even better than the original version. I think that they should've put the radio version of City High - What Would You Do, because the version on this CD is edited too much, the radio version just edits the swearing.Since all of the songs were good, I give this CD 5/5 stars.
__label__1 Historical narrative disguised as a cookbook: Clearly the author fell in love with Sicily; I do not fault him for that. Secondly, indeed the food of Sicily is marvelous, fresh and a combination of ingredients which reflect its diverse ethnic history over centuries. However, the author's recipes are ponderous because he really wants to give detailed history of the embattled island of Sicily over two thousand years. Either write an historical essay or a cookbook. I don't think this author made up his mind as to which avenue he was pursuing: historical or culinary. There are a couple of simple recipes I am tempted to try; however, most of them are difficult and many ingredients are impossible to find, here in the meatloaf/mashed potatoes Midwest.
__label__1 Look at it before buying: If I had browsed through this book before buying it, I would have rejected it for these reasons: content is superficial, author's tone is smarty-pants academic as well as wordy,and the illustrations are poorly reproduced.
__label__2 An original story of one man's most intimate struggle with himself and the family he leaves behind: Frederick Reuss' Mohr: A Novel is the engagingly entertaining tale of Jewish author, playwright, and medical doctor, Max Mohr and his decision to embark upon a voyage to the far shores of Shanghai. The journey presents many unforeseen difficulties resulting in the necessity for a series of relentless struggles. But Max is determined to leave his wife and family in order to distance himself from the ravages of war in Europe for what he perceive will be a quiet life in a beautiful China, all the while his expedition is unwittingly leading himself directly into the heart of a war in China Mohr is very highly recommended reading as an original story of one man's most intimate struggle with himself and the family he leaves behind for what turns out to be an unexpected future.
__label__2 Very fine effort for Shania after just having done both the Grey Cup and Super Bowl halftime shows!: Fine LIVE Chicago Concert for girl fromOntario, who actually (gasp!0 loved theCFL and NHL growing up! She could haveREALLY impressed us at MYKwebTV by pul-ling the hat trick and doing the halftimeof the ArenaBowl as well! Excellent setof thunpin' Country, Rock and combined-Pop songs here. Pick Up On It!
__label__2 amazing: this biscuit pan does a fantastic job. Whether its homemade biscuits, frozen biscuits, muffins, or brownies. Everything comes out crisp all the way around. It is truly nonstick if you keep it seasoned.
__label__2 the rise of Featherson: this book traces the rise of Jake Featehrson from a small local Freedom party meeting to a presidential canidate it also traces how many confederates feel after the war and the inflation that follows and this helps explain how featherson becomes such a threat
__label__1 useless crap: 20% of Hashimoto's patients go into remission - it's an auto-immune disease, like lupus or MS, so some lucky people can do nothing or do totally stupid things, and still get "cured". This means that the experiences of one person who got better are anything but proof that what he did will make *you* better. You'll do much better to look at books by Mary Shoman or Ridha Arem.
__label__1 Lower your child's self-esteem with Chicken Little!: I read all of the 1 star and 2 star comments and was shocked that no one mentioned the real problem of the movie...Everyone is just plain mean to Chicken Little. Why? Even the dad openly says that he's embarrassed of his kid. You would think that he would be extremely protective of his son ever since the wife's (hen's) absence. Chicken Little is surprisingly strong-willed despite the fact that everyone in the town considers him to be crazy and a loser. Other than the fact that he's small the characters all promote bullying. And what was the redeeming factor of the movie? The lead chick tells his dad that "he's never there for him." Duh. ... My daughter is 2.5 and really didn't get the story. All she saw was bright lights, loud noises, and cute animals. She obviously liked the movie. There's no way I'll show this to her when she's older. I can just picture her asking me, "How come the daddy chicken hates Chicken Little?" ...umm
__label__2 Works fine.: Would like some more options/controls, but for the $$ this is a great unit and it does its job satisfactorily.
__label__1 Makes Lethal Weapon 4 look like a great sequel: I heard they might make a part 4, what''s it gonna be called ? "Return to Wolly World" ? lol. This is a very mildly entertaining 3rd sequel that brings Foley to a fun park called Wolly World to face some new villains. The results is an often very [bad] film with a script that should of stayed in the garbage. If you have any interest at all in it just rent it don't buy it. Buy the first 2, this one is so bad it pretty near ruined Murphy's career.
__label__2 Great Product and Vendor: This Product is a great multi-vitamin supplement. So many people complain about taking eleven pills, but I believe it is totally worth it in that you truly do feel more energy throughout your day after taking these. I've taken many different types of multi-vitamins and I can honestly say that Animal Pack is by far the best ever. Also, this vendor typically ships very quickly and product is in mint condition when it arrives to you.
__label__1 1 star because 0 stars was unavailable!: Do listen to the sour grapes reviews. This book is for people looking for meals that you cannot pull together without first shopping at multiple locations to purchase the ingredients. I prefer simple recipes with items I can find in my pantry or pick up on my way home from work. Save your $$$!!!!
__label__2 great single, great b-side: Damage is a great song, and Open All Night, which is one of the B-sides, is unbelivable!! You Am I are one of the few bands to put decent B-Sides on their singles.
__label__1 I couldn't even finish...: Being a huge fan of Jane Austen, I was very excited about reading this. However, the farther I got, the more I felt like I had been "suckered" into reading it because of the title and supposed JA connection. There were some pretty disgusting things in it(and being a college student, I'm not that easily offended either), and I felt like it was not at all true to the spirit of Austen herself to include them. Besides this, most of the characters were about as lovable as Mr. Collins (Allegra especially just irritated the heck out of me!) If it weren't for the fact that this book was given to me, I would feel cheated out of my hard-earned money as well!
__label__1 ABC News Nightline Fragile X Syndrome: I bought this DVD thinking it would educate me as the cause of the condition with a view toward identyfying intervention options. The DVD focused on the story of one middle class couple of privilege. Rarely did it touch on issues that were transferable to parents with Fragile X syndrome children in general. This was a very poor investment on my part and I do not recommeded it.
__label__1 Terribly over-priced: While the book itself is a nice guide on creating nail art, the polish that comes with it peels off entirely too easily, so all of the nail art you have painstakingly created comes off before the hour is up - unless you are doing nothing but sitting in a chair with your hands flat on the table for that hour.Either the caliber of nail polish needs to be changed or the price needs to come WAY down for this to be anything short of a rip-off.My daughter and I bought some Wet and Wild polish and will try again. Too bad we couldn't get that money reimbursed from the price of this book.
__label__2 An energetic cult classic: I had no idea, until a few months ago, that the movie I had adore since 1994 had become an all out classic, spurring conventions, merchandise and over 150 websites. Whoa, I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Roundhouse (it has 4 of the stars from RH in it) and loves to move and sing.
__label__2 jen: My daughter wanted Easy-bake oven and this is a great alternative.It also comes with 4 recipes that makes 2 small pizzas so it is great for a snack!-Easy Cheesy Pizza-Stuffed Crust Pizza-Carmel Apple Cookie Pizza-Raspberry Cheesecake Pizzano pre-mixed stuff here. It's great for them to learn fractions (cups) and to measure tea/ tablespoons.
__label__2 Original And Compelling: I've heard complaints that this book is a difficult read. In ways I can understand. This is not a book you read casually when you have nothing else better to do. In the tradition of Issac Asimov, Audrey Niffenegger weaves a detailed, complex and interesting tapestry that requires close attention. But the end result is well worth the extra effort. Not for everyone, Traveler will appeal to casual fans of sci-fi and romantic buffs alike who are willing to invest the time this book requires. I prefer my sci-fi in small doses, as plot elements rather than being the central plot, as evidenced in my own work. Niffenegger comes through with an original, compelling work.BJ NeblettElysian Dreams: Where the Past Meets the Present
__label__2 A Good Deal: This has been the primary lens on my Digial Rebel (first generation) and is now on my Rebel XSI. I find it is great for travel and its long focal length is perfect for outdoor shots from a distance. I tend to switch to the 18-55 kit lens from the XSI when indoors (when I think of it) but have been very happy with the results even when I have not made the switch.The only negative is the weight and tendency for the lens to extend on its own due to its weight if the lock is not used (and who wants to switch that every time?).Anyway for the enthusiast like me this is a perfect lens. For the professional, look to Canon's L-series with the same range but for about $2,000 more - and please buy a spare one and send it my way!
__label__2 Different twist to vampire book: This is an adult book not you young readers. A different twist to your typical vampire books. Kinda reminds me of the mafia, only with vampires.
__label__2 Great hose: I don't understand the reviews about this hose not lasting. I bought my first swan soft and supple hose 22 years ago. I am still using it. I bought a new one 2 years ago, and it seems like the same great quality.I live in Wisconsin, and leave the hose out all winter, and it has lasted just fine.Perhaps it just doesn't do well in southern heat, but in Wisconsin, it's a great long-lasting hose.
__label__2 "Perfect Size": These crates are the perfect size for me to store the items from my classroom durning the summer. They are convenient to take back and forth. After I empty them, I just store them away takining up a small space until I need them again.Armada 18-3/4 Inch by 13-1/2 Inch by 9 Inch Large Collapsible Crate
__label__1 Americans Are So Full Of Themselves!: Americans are so full of themselves! It's always all about them, and never about the people whose lives they destroy.Three million Viet Namese died during the US occupation and aggression in Viet Nam. The illegal US bombing of Cambodia killed another 500,000 people, and an additional three million people died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge, who were supplied and supported by the US government.Yet all the Ameicans ever talk about or care about are the 57,000 US troops that died in Viet Nam. The US troops were the aggressors in Viet Nam, and they were carrying out genocide against the Viet Namese people. I never felt any sympathy for the US troops at all, and I do not respect those who do.
__label__2 Another inspiration..: Another wonderful book, thank you! You will take away so much more than your expected, enjoy!
__label__1 main character is not very bright and becomes less than believable: About two thirds of the way through the plot disappears and the main character is just too ignorant be believable. The book turns into actions socially acceptible to 21 century readers but not credible in the Victorian age.
__label__2 slade alive: Fantastic, have the vynal still and wanted a copy to put on all my devices, and this is great sound outstanding and great cover.Rockin the Fillmore
__label__1 The Worst Lindsey I've Read: I normally enjoy any book written by Johanna Lindsey, but this one was extremely disappointing. Lousy plot and a very slow and boring read. If you are normally a Lindsey fan I think this book will disappoint you.
__label__2 elegant yet practical: I was really pleased with these dishes (and Mom was pleased to receive them for Christmas). I was a little scared the colors and pattern might be gaudy, tacky, cheap-looking, but they aren't at all. Some of the online photos I saw must have been taken in really poor lighting that did not do these dishes justice.
__label__2 Toy Review: This is a great classic toy from the 1990's xmen series. It's really cool and lots of fun. The eyes on it do look a little creepy but its really cool none the less. Lots of fun great for kids and collectors.
__label__2 Not his best; more like "Football with Morrie": Let's first off establish that this book is not one of John Grisham's best books. It doesn't hold a candle to "A Time to Kill" or "The Partner." This book, however, is best read by those who love and appreciate sports or who have had an influential coach in their life. Other wise, the passages describing games and plays will drone on for a little too long.After ten years Grisham still his own way of telling a story that is as comfortable as slipping on a favorite pair of pajamas. Bleachers is a quick romp, but not much to savor.
__label__2 Literature comes back to life - bringing the trains with it.: A series of short stories that will leave you hungering for more. Top name authors who you never knew could even understand a train, let alone wirte about them - but they all rode them. I only read one of these stories before. The superb surprise, an O. Henry without a surprise ending.
__label__1 THE SPACE STATION IS FALLING: In this sequel to the original Stratos 4 anime, our four heroines are finally able to take a breather from the constant bombardment of Earth by alien space seeds. Uh, let me correct that, no rest is given when one of the Comet Blaster orbiting satellites is hit by a piece of space debris. There's no way for it to be saved and it's too big to burn up in the atmosphere so it must be destroyed before it hits the Earth. As two Comet Blasters man a desperate mission to rescue the space stations crew, Shizuha, Ayamo, Mikaze, and Karin set out to vaporize it.The two episodes on this dvd really didn't do much for me. They did not extend the story of the original series or bring anything new to the show. Instead of meteors, we have a space station. It was a little funny but I think that Stratos 4 is pretty much played out. Unless you take it in a different direction and get away from the whole meteor blasting business. This is kinda like a skimpy dessert after the main course.
__label__2 Junie B Jones Party Animal: I really enjoy the Junie B. Jones series to read to my grandaughter at bedtime. She is in kindergarden so they have been perfect through school year. Looking forward to the First Grade books, she likes picking out each book. Cute series!
__label__2 Best of the Coltrane Pharoah Sanders Collaberations!: This CD reissues what was arguably the finest of the John Coltrane-Pharoah Sanders collaborations. On five diverse but almost consistently intense movements ("The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost," "Compassion," "Love," "Consequences," and "Serenity"), the two tenor saxophonists, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and both Elvin Jones and Rashied Ali on drums create some powerful, dense, and emotional music. Unlike some of the live jams of 1966, the passionate performances never ramble on too long and the screams and screeches fit logically into the spiritual themes. This would be the last recording of Coltrane with Tyner and Jones. Review by Scott Yanow
__label__2 The Essential Beatles: I've been a Beatles fan early this year and I'm getting to know a lot about The Beatles and their music. The Beatles 1962-1966 aka The Red Album contains their greatest hits from the years 1962-1966. Four songs are in mono mix and the rest are in stereo mix. The sound quality is crisp and clear and remastered very well. In the booklet it includes pages full of Beatles pictures, history of their music and lyrics which is a good idea to include in the booklet. My favorite tracks are "I Want To Hold Your Hand," "Love Me Do," "A Hard Day's Night," "I Feel Fine," "We Can Work It Out" and "In My Life." If you want a Beatles CD with their greatest hits, you should add this album to your Beatles collection.
__label__2 Great sheets, incredible price: We are very happy with them - they fit the bed, wash well, feel comfortable and they were at a great price.
__label__1 Disturbing, and not in a good way: I found this novel deeply disturbing: are we really meant to sympathize with and care about the oh-so-sensitive alcoholic child-beating male protagonist simply because he is Maori and can blather on about ancestors and sacred spaces ? The destroyed child , progressively more destroyed and brutalized over the course of the novel, stands for what? It appears that the author wants us to approve of his pathetic attachment to his adoptive father....I didn't believe a word of the peculiarly happy ending. The author seems proud of her supposedly innovative style, which didn't seem particulalry innovative to me.
__label__2 about the movie an affair of love: This movie basically talk about how a man get to know the woman and slowly turned into a relationship etc etc. The story for this movie is good BUT if you are that someone that would rather prefer lots of erotic scenes, get away from this title as there is not much of sex scenes inside. There is only one sex scene(the sitting method) where there is a blanket covering the body of the actress and actor.
__label__2 Great taste: Good Earth is a great tasting decaf white tea, which is more healthy even than green tea. It is very hard to find in health food or regular food stores, so glad to know it is availablethrough Amazon.
__label__1 Destruction Complete: After firing Ross Valory and Steve Smith, Steve Perry produced what essentially sounded like a Steve Perry solo album. If you love 80s cheesy synths and robotic percussion then this is for you. If however, you were a fan from the pre-Perry days, this represented the complete demise of the original spirit of the band. Although this record leans toward R&B, Perry (stadium rock god that he was) was no Sam Cooke and the music lacks authenticity. "Be Good to Yourself" reminds of past glories, but "Suzanne" is painful and plastic.
__label__1 Great for midgets: Quality is only fair, and the unit is so short that you have to stoop to take a shower.I dumped the pole and stand and used the hose and shower head by fastening it to the top of the Zodi shower enclosure, and it worked fine.
__label__1 Not what I expected: This is the first new trumpet I have owned, so at first when the valves frequently stuck I thought maybe they needed some time to "break in". However, after 4 months of frustration I still cannot play for 15 minutes without one or more valves dragging and sticking, in spite of being frequently oiled and cleaned. I am very dissatisfied with this trumpet. Right now I am thinking about filing a warranty claim.
__label__1 BPA plastic: I bought this item to make "Bread in 5 Minutes a Day," too. Great book! However, when I recieved the Cambro round, I sent it back. It is made of plastic #7, shown inside the recycling symbol on the bottom. Plastic #7 can contain BPA. If you are trying to avoid BPA in food storage items, I would avoid this item. Some states already have laws requiring baby food products be BPA-free and the FDA has medical concerns about it, including potential links to breast and prostate cancer and early onset puberty. Why add more to my home? I would hope Amazon would add the plastic type to this item's product description to inform customers.
__label__2 Simply amazing: I went with a couple of friends to see Papa Roach and Blindside in concert and Memento was opening for them. I had never heard of Memento before. After the night was over, everyone in the club agreed that Memento was the BEST of all - yes, they are that good! I bought the CD right after and couldn't stop listening to it. They are amazing. Every single song - unlike other one-hit wonder bands - is awesome. Get it now!
__label__2 Pretty pretty pretty gooood.: I bought this for my 6 x 4 hockey net that has been sitting on the side of my house for the past 6 years. I have to say this was an excellent alternative than buying a new pipe. The bungee cord is a hell of a lot more convenient than having to tie the net onto the posts. The only let down for me was that it tends to rip when taking hard shots with an ice hockey puck (but surprisingly enough, not that often). My advice for hockey players out there: try buying two of these nets, or maybe even three. That should definitely fix the issue, which I'm actually considering myself. For all intents and purposes, this is an effective net.
__label__1 Not a good resource during M3 clerkship.: I can't say how these questions might compare to the surgery shelf exam, because I haven't taken it yet. I can definitely say that this book isn't good preparation, because the explanations don't make any sense. The first chapter is Trauma. I read my assigned textbook's chapter on trauma, attended my rotation's trauma lecture, and then tried my hand at this book. The questions didn't have anything to do with what I'd read in the textbook or heard in lecture. Question 1 deals with proper used of a Steimann pin for a supracondylar fracture. What??? The explanation didn't give any more info above saying that this fracture should be treated with a Steimann pin... didn't mention WHY that answer choice was correct, why the other answer choices were incorrect, or what a Steimann pin was. If you're looking for a question book that will actually teach you something, look elsewhere.
__label__2 Great work...: Most of the tracks are wonderful. The Enhanced CD part includes a full video for "What Do You Say", along with interviews and 3d pictures - definitely worth watching. I've taken off a star for the part where this guy says "the third verse would be better if somebody died" during production - you don't have to make the songs SO depressing (the graveyard returns in "Roses"). Overall it's great, you can really tell these people worked a lot and spent tons of money on this album.
__label__1 Worthless. Don't waste your money.: I received this game as a Christmas gift. It will not run. I tried 2 computers and on both it crashes at the sign-in screen. I emailed Encore about the problem but I've had no response. Jeopardy Deluxe is going into the trash.
__label__2 Classic John Carpenter: I loved this movie when it first came out and the love affair starts all over again. I have watched VHS copies of this over the years and now the DVD is unbelievable. The DVD transfer on this movie is incredible. Tons of extras and a fun movie who can resist that? Can I compare cheese such as this to wine? Lets try. This movie gets better with age, Jack Burton, like a fine wine, gets better with age. A must in any DVD collection.
__label__1 DONT BUY IT: I bought this game a week ago. I thought it would be good.I soon knew that I just wasted 50 dollars. PLEASE do not get this game you will not regret it.I changed the difficulty to easy on all modes, but it turns out ta be EXTREMLEY HARD.O YAH, and you work SOOOOO hard for a secret character and it only unlocks him in versus. WHAT A [WASTE!!!] SO... if you r lookin for a good fightin game atleast save your money or get sumthin else, like mortal kombat deadly alliance or DOA 3. BUT whatever you do not get this game. :.)
__label__2 awesome: my kids love this toy. they take karate and this is great practice for their skill of balance and focus
__label__2 Still as good as day 1.: Great animation, great voice acting, and great story! The only thing I'm disapointed in is their wasn't a second and third movie (but the series made up for it, particularly the early episodes.)
__label__2 Great, Kitties all love this, all 6 of them !!: this is great with the refil bottle, no more daily filling of the water, I clean weekly with the tools bought for the purpose and it is a time saver. No more having to worry about the level of the water, or burning out the motor if I forget to fill. the base is wide enough so even our biggest kitty can drink without discomfort and he loves drinking out of the fountain. Absolutely no sound from the motor and the gentle water sound is very soothing. Would definately recommend this product !!!!
__label__1 Broke on first day: My brother bought this to go fishing with when I was going to take him and his son's fishing. After about 30 min of fishing it broke in half. My 13 year old nephew was using it. He was casting, the lure caught on a railing and it snapped. Pretty pathetic if you ask me.
__label__2 This has everything...: action, adventure,romance,intrigue, bad guys, our two good guys, awesome actors and actresses and a fantastic ending. The only thing that could make this better,is for you to watch it yourself!
__label__2 Very good and practical: What I liked the most about this book is it's practical application. It is easy to read but not shallow. It is the first book I read from these authors and I was very pleased with it. Will certainly buy other books from them.
__label__2 This was very helpful for my new waling daughter!!!!!!!!: This was a very good buy for our daughter, as she was learning to walk, she is 19 months and still plays and rides on it. Every time we go to any store, and she sees it......she laughs and pushes the little nose as it plays. We love it, and hope you do too.
__label__1 Elton's Tank Runs Out Of Gas: Sadly, Elton's string of great 70's albums comes to an abrupt halt with the release of what has to be his weakest album since "Empty Sky" (or the "Friends" soundtrack for that matter). It's sad to watch how low his standards had plummeted in the 3 years since "Don't Shoot Me" and "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road". Instead of the driving rock of "Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting" Rock of the Westies serves up the cliche-driven "Grow Some Funk Of Your Own". Taupin's usual lyrical cleverness is conspicuously absent from weak songs like "I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun Of Robert Ford)" and "Billy Bones". Granted, Elton still had a ways to fall, but his descent unquestionably begins with "Rock Of The Westies". I recommend any of his albums prior to this one. This is not the Elton John CD to spend your 13 bucks on if you havent yet purchased "Dont Shoot Me", "Honky Chateau" or "Madman Across The Water".
__label__2 funky sensibility fo' sho': i love it! i play it over and over! slammin ' mix of ecclectic trax! luscious!
__label__1 An exercise in denial: Wake up people-we can't spend our lives avoiding the huge ships! It is unhealthy, and leads to poor decision making, imprecise grammar, and questionable grooming habits. At some point, we just have to stand tall, and take the huge ships head on. So don't reinforce your huge ship avoidance habits by reading this book, it is a false comfort. Start today by going down to the docks, looking those huge ships in the bow, and shaking your fists menacingly. You will feel empowered immediately, and next thing you know, you will be fearlessly crossing paths with large trees, immense piles of stone, and really really huge other stuff.
__label__2 This is a Great Book!!: I LOVE this book. Just as the first reviewer, I WISH I had had this book from Semester One of my college career. Beautiful, clear illustrations. Organized, easy to understand text. I'm thrilled to have this book. It's a 'Keeper.'
__label__2 does the job and easy to use: Surprisingly good but use the right cleaning products. I damaged the tank by using boiling water and it was easy to order a replacemnt with bissell online. Just use hot tap water. Perfect for my studio apartment. I use it weekly instead of a regular vacuum cleaner.
__label__1 wrong item: the description says for Nintendo DS, my packaging says for game boy. It won't work on a DS Lite. The seller wants me to pay to ship it back and $2. Be careful on the descriptions!!
__label__2 How can you not like this!: What a debut album! People say they sound like Thursday. I personally don't hear the similarity. TBS has a more punk influence to emo while Thursday is emocore. My favorite songs are Bike Scene, Ghost Man on Third, You're So Last Summer, and Head Club. I've read some other peoples reviews on this and they didn't seem to like Head Club, but I sure do. It just rocks! Everytime I listen to it, I just keep making it louder and louder. Trust me, get this album. I love it and I'm sure you will too.
__label__2 Loved it!: I laughed out loud in several parts...the roaches in the foot washing tub. Cracker's blind mule opened my eyes to a flawed yet wonderful world that I did not want to leave.
__label__2 Another Grisham winner.: I am still reading this book but so far it is as good, or even better, than other novels by Grisham I have read.
__label__1 Don't Bother: The worst thing about this CD is that it took forever to end. I can say 3 good things about this CD:1. It was very cheap2. The song Nothing In This World is pretty good!3. The absolute best thing about this CD is that it does finally end!
__label__2 LTBROWN RATES FAMILY REUNION: ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE AND HEART FELT. THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE REQUIRED VIEWING FOR ALL PEOPLE.
__label__2 Code LYOKO: I have studied this show, although that it is a cartoon, which would make most adults ignore it, it has to do with advanced calculations and programming beyond normal comprehension. Programming into a computer, turning a real world person, and transferring him/her inside of a supercomputer virus running parallel to the human world, which could infect and kill humans. Once you get into this, it is a pretty good show.
__label__1 Great potential, but little reward: "Moo" begins very well, but it stretches itself too far in an attempt to cover an Altmanesque cast of main characters - only about half of which are interesting. So much time is spent on character development that a story never seems to evolve.
__label__2 I'm Really Starting To Like Remington...: I bought this to go with my MS2-200BPT Shaver. I saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well. I've been using it for about 1 month and I couldn't agree more. A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new. I can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since I've started using it. As a bonus, it seems to last quite a while. Another strong product from Remington!
__label__1 Boring: This novel is not a thriller. It was not suspenseful. It was painful to read and I had to force myself not to skip through it. I kept thinking it was going to get better and after all the "positive reviews" it was such a let down. I am glad to be done with it.
__label__1 Problematic: I purchased the Point Driver as a professional photographer doing much of my own framing. I was disappointed that the driver never fired with enough force to secure the points in the frame. I braced the frame against a surface and adjusted the tension as tight as could be yet never received satisfactory results. In fact, despite how tight I adjusted the tension, the pointer never fired differently. I do not use 'hard wood' or any materials that would be difficult to penetrate. Each time I used my Fletcher point driver I had to push points in with a flathead screwdriver by hand to secure them in the wood and keep them from falling out when the frame was lifted. Very disappointing, particularly with the price tag.
__label__1 Just Plain Horrible: This movie has no sense of script. The two people that fall in love barely even meet eachother when they do. I would write more, but this movie was so boring I practically fell asleep through it and I just can't remember much of it. Never buy it. If you want to see a real movie than go to a theater to watch Chicago.
__label__2 A great read: I was loath to pick this book up when it came out. "Rose"?! Please. Stuck with the flu, I had no choice but to pick it up - and I loved it. I've given it another try - and could hardly put it down. Evocative writing and excellent dialog really pull this book along. Is it "Renko in 1872"? There is perhaps something to that. But, I didn't care. This is a great murder mystery, with fascinating historical background
__label__2 Need to have tools & be handy to get this assembled in under 3 hours: Now that our table is assembled, it is wonderful. I have a 4 year old & a 2 year old... love it! However, plan on 2-3 hour assembly if you are handy. If you don't have tools or don't know how to use them if you do, don't bother buying it. I probably would have paid another $50 to have it assembled. I will also say that it is probably too small for kids over 5. My daughter fits at it comfortably now, but I would imagine it will get tight soon. Good quality... love the umbrella.
__label__2 Best I've had: This is the best pedometer I have had and I have had 3 before. The only problem is that sometimes it flips off my slacks but I think part of that is my fault.It is EASY to program and check. I LOVE IT.Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer
__label__2 Nice movie: It's a nice movie for an evening when one wants to relax. I've already watched it twice in the last couple of weeks. Beautiful music, and the movie is clean, not trashy at all.
__label__2 Powerful: Anytime women get together to learn more about their Savior great things happen. This study was challenging, encouraging and powerful!! Loved it
__label__2 Works well: It's a "bit" small but gives enough of a breeze to cool the back of the van. I run the air and it draws the air to the back (where the dogs are).
__label__2 Hiding things in unusual places: Good overview of how to hide a variety of items in unusual places; may either be well hidden or hidden in plain sight. Something here for everyone.
__label__1 Most overrated album of 1998: Years in the making, enduring endless rerecordings and producer switches, this album arrived to no end of hype. Sad thing is, all the energy people devoted to it before it came out must have made everyone think they had to continue the hype even after finding out the album simply isn't very good. Williams' voice notwithstanding (too many criticisms of her focus on that), it's her writing that is poor. For a poet laurate's daughter, you'd think she'd be able to venture beyond cliche and half-baked ideas in her writing. Critic David Fricke called this the "Blonde on Blonde" of the '90s. Revoke his license.
__label__1 Not helpful: I ordered this book after reading so many good reviews on amazon.com. Studied the book from front to back reading, taking notes, etc. I took each practice test twice scoring 70's and 80's. I felt so ready for the test yesterday. When I started the test, I was a little nervous because the 1st six questions were not on info in the book. I thought, "Well, the Clep book cant cover everything" and was not too worried. By question 20, I began to worry. While this book has great info it did not have the detailed info needed for this version of the US History II Clep exam. Quotes, authors, a lot of culture and sadly after my relentless studying I FAILED with a 45. That turns out to 38 questions that I answered correctly. Do not simply rely on this book like I did. For some it sounds like it was awesome because of the version of the test they took. I was lost.
__label__1 Terrible: Well I thought I was going to be the only one who hated this movie, but now that I've read the other reviews, at least I know why it's so bad. I hadn't known it was going to be so cut up. It's so disjointed that it's impossible to follow. And, I hate to say it, but Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this is sub-par. Every role I've seen him in (up to this point) has been outstanding, so this was a major disappointment. The only good thing I can say is that I am VERY glad I was able to see this before purchasing it, so now I don't have to waste my money. Watch "The Aviator" instead.. it tells a lot of the same story, but it's done so much better, and the acting in that movie is incredible. This movie is barely even a story. Disappointing!!!!
__label__2 Good book!: This book was assigned to my son as a school homework assignment. It was wonderful. I read it myself. My son was able to identify with the character Bobby and he can't wait to read more of the series.
__label__2 A good story from a youth turning into an adult: Thisis a good story from a kid who recognises the mistake of getting engaged to a gitrl just befoer going for a tour in Vietman. a Sniper the work has only jjust begun to be ecognised as a'artillary' for Grunts, thisis shown as is the poor morale the inability to grasp what is goin gon by the american publec and a strong mother to keep him sane.I lik ethe action bits. Sound soldiers with a good morale code, still I would use silver tipped bullets, what's the difference if you going to kill someone?A good story, honetly told.
__label__2 Great for any Christian music fan, new or old: The WOW Hits series is great - and 2007 is no exception!If you're not familiar with the series, WOW Hits only is released once a year, usually in October. There are two discs: Blue (disc one) has Adult Contemporary and Worship songs on it. Pink (disc two) has Pop and Rock songs on it. The second disc is the one that I prefer to listen to, but I do like to listen to the first disc sometimes also.This series is great for introducing someone to today's Christian music. I had a coworker who wasn't familiar with today's Christian artists, but likes Christian music. So I recommended WOW Hits to her!
__label__2 THE VOCALS ON THIS TUNE WILL MAKE YOU STAND UP AND SHOUT: Why this song never got more air play, I'll never understand. The vocals are the best we will ever hear!
__label__1 Disappointed Mom: We received this as an early Christmas gift for our 10 month old daugher and it was immediately apparent that this toy is VERY UNSAFE even with constant supervision. The wheels roll too fast on anything but shag carpet and it is too light and flimsy to stay upright when in use. We have decided to throw it away before our baby really gets hurt. This product should be recalled.
__label__1 Nothing we don't already know !: Treat it as fun because it doesn't tell you anything that you don't already know about common sense and the sense of proportion. But it's ideal for tossing around the house and goes well with your Tiffany's publications collection because they have kind of the same colour scheme!
__label__2 Pretty but fragile: This light is very pretty it sports a sleek design, which in my case was it's downfall.I was tightening the nut that holds the globe and the top busted. I put some superglue on it and it works though.All in all though it is a very pretty light.

__label__2 Now our third purchase: We use this olive oil for cooking daily. However, when we run out of the more flavorful specialized olive oil that we use daily in salad dressings and a "finishing oil" this one is still so much better than the more common olive oils in the store. AND per ounce is significantly less expensive per ounce than all the oils in the local food store and way better quality than can be found in "big box" stores. Now that they are packaging it better for shipping we're completely satisfied. First shipment great. Second shipment no packaging material used in box and can was dented. We immediately poured it all out into a large plastic pitcher. Oil was fine, can did not leak, but not the point. Tried 1 more time and yesterday it came in packaged well and can in good condition. Don't be concerned about quantity, I had 1 instance when about 1/2 can of this oil ended up in the cabinet for 6 months and it was just fine, probably could have gone a year.
__label__1 better to have stayed home: if you have a choice, do not buy this. if you own it. do not watch it.it is the story of two very silly young girls on vacation in barcelona, and older man who just wants sex with anything that moves and looks female, and his crazy exwife. the man and wife are painters, so called, and the examples of their work will clearly make you understand why she is crazy and he is sexually obsessed.the funniest part is meeting with his father, who will speak no other language than spanish, though catalan is the tongue of barcelona, he is a poet and he believes his poems are only to be written in spanish, but he refuses to publish them because he is angry at the world and this is his way of punishing it. bad poet , bad poems, nutty character. that pretty much describes the story.
__label__1 Hat too big!: Don't waste your money! Cheaply made and its too big! Didn't like it at all and falls off!! Don't buy!
__label__2 Don't trust Amazon's parts database: I'm a big fan of Wix Filters and give them 4 stars. However, this one is listed as the correct filter for my Volvo V50, but it's not - not even close to the correct size. This was my first oil change with this car, so I didn't think anything was amiss when I received the filter. Too bad I ordered in advance and didn't do an oil change until after the return window was over.I ended up having to leave the car up on the lift, wash myself off, and drive to O'Reilly to buy the right filter.
__label__2 Amazing book!: After reading this book, I am really beginning to believe anything is possible. The book is not quite what I expected,but turned out to be more incredible than 90% of the books I have read. Several people have recommended I read this book, so I got a copy from Amazon. I plan to read it several more times to make sure I really "got it".
__label__2 One of the best!: Over the past few years, I have had several cordless vacs. This is one of the best. My only negative comment would be no side vac. The most positive, is the length of time the charge last, and the suction. I love this cordless vaccum.
__label__2 A insiders view of a great college coach: JoePa's little brother gives you the inside story of one ,if not the best, college football coaches in America. Tells of there early years in NY, the family ties, and who or what influenced them both.It's a good book that gives you a look into the human side of Joe and the way it affected his family and in paticular his little brother George.
__label__2 The Secrtet Path: I've got this book as a persent from my friend and I was amaized to see that it decribed something that I experienced without knowing what was it, something that can't be compered with anything we have experienced in our life or even imagine something like this.It is the pure truth, written by the one who was lucky enough to disover for himself the essence of who we are.I would recomend this book to those who are in search for the truth.
__label__2 Josette's Eye is some of the BEST talent in a long time!: After long-awaited anticipation, Josette's Eye has release a stunning cd readily available to the public. "Alibi Clock" has captured the thrill and sheer talents of the band. The lyrics are amazing & the vocals are excellent. If you've never seen Josette's Eye in concert, you now have the opportunity to own all the all the excitement on cd. Josette's Eye is sure to keep you entertained throughout the day. Enjoy!
__label__2 We're all connected...: An interesting examination of the relationship between energy was and many of the sacred sites of the ancient world. The film posits "the Merry Maidens," in Cornwall, England, as the site at which these "energy lines" intersect. A great film for anyone who is interested in connectivity and quantum physics.
__label__1 Strictly kids fare: Cute story, poor acting, poor directing, terrible singing....but then you know that. The DVD transfer is sub-standard. Picture quality is acceptable, but not better than VHS. Turn off your surround decoder or the whole movie comes through the center channel. I realize that this was a mono movie made in 1939, but surely a little time could have been taken to give it an AC-3 soundtrack. No extras on the disc worth mentioning. One more note: original theatrical presentation doesn't mean widescreen in this case. The original aspect ratio was close enough to 4:3 that the DVD was pressed as 4:3. Buy this disc if you don't mind your kids playing with the DVD player, otherwise wait for Ted Turner to broadcast it.
__label__1 Truly Moving: Paso a Paso 2 is truly amazing. I wasn't even taking Spanish class when I accidentally bought this book. Reading this book is so emotional, inspirational, and heart-warming. The pictures included in this book were so meaningful and full of life. I felt as thougth I was reading National Geographic and John Steinbeck's The Pearl mixed together. This wonderful textbook has changed my life completely! If you need a book to read, Paso a Paso 2 is the perfect book. I recommend this book completely!
__label__1 Horrible: The accuracy on this thing is horrible. I only use it when I really need to because its so bad. You can click one direction with the joystick and when you let off it will send your character back in the other direction. Its almost impossible to do things that require lining something up or going in a precise direction. I would NOT recommend this controller to anyone.
__label__1 who buys this manufactured rubbish?: I think hilary should stick to acting, this cd is the worst i have heard for a long time!!!
__label__1 Great at first, but gives F03 errors on every battery now: I really liked this battery charger at first. It worked flawlessly for about a year with intermittent use on my motorcycle. Then it began giving "F03" errors. I suspected the Harley battery and bought a new one. First time I put the charger on for a trickle maintenance charge, it reported "F03" errors. I then tried the charger on many batteries. Always "F03".Since every battery I hook the charger to gives "F03" errors, I'm thinking that the charger is faulty. Looked on the internet and found dozens of reports of "F03" errors on good batteries.I won't buy another. Going back to a simple charger.Ken
__label__1 a generous 2 stars for a very young Angie Dickinson: At 74 minutes this late 50's B western is still amazingly bloated with too much ...of nothing. This could have been cut down to 50minutes and played on TV and still would have been cliche riddled and boring but acceptable. James Arness is pretty wooden...the villians and plot are a complete cliche and the ONLY reason to watch is to see "and introducing Angie Dickinson" who out acts everyone else in the movie. The Director Andrew Mclaglen, developed into a pretty good one and that was one of the reasons I gave this a try. Save your 10 bucks and put it towards a Rawhide season set or even a Gunsmoke if that's your taste...this isn't worth your time.I rarely write negative reviews...but I figure there are many out there like me curious because of the talent level and being a John Wayne production ...but its truly B or C level.
__label__2 Vintage Fire Truck Wall Border: Easily put up, not as easy to match the pattern. Would definitely recommend to anyone
__label__2 Love it!: I'm not a musician, composer etc. so I cannot say anything more technical than - Absolutely wonderful!Got to be one of the best Jazz CD's I own.
__label__2 up with the best: Colin Friels is probably less known or acclaimed internationally than his wife Judy Davis. His effort in this miniseries though early in his career should have him right up there equally recognized. A great story and a miniseries collectable.
__label__2 Voice of a generation: This book is truly the voice of a generation! Millions of people now take responsibility for their own gallbladders & liver health. The results? - less costly [to the tax payer] & painful surgeries ~ which also means avoiding the very real possibility of hospital infections! My own liver/gallbladder is very happy - thank you Andreas
__label__1 Don't waste Your Money On This Garbage.........: This is a book poorly composed and full of ant-Christian Propaganda...There is no other way to describe it. Potential readers are better advised to read Julius Norwich..He is Neutral and objective, looking at all sides of the issues cocerned....
__label__1 Weed eater can't build an engine that runs!: I threw out the last two Weed eater brand trimmers I had because I could not keep them running, IF they started.I used this one 3 months before it quit. It runs, for a while, with full chock on! Dies instantly when taken off.I WILL NEVER, NEVER, NEVER BY ANOTHER ONE FROM WEEDEATER!
__label__2 One of my favourite from Terry: Faith of the fallen is easily one of the best Goodkind books in the series. Although in some ways, it's underlying theme could be considered rudimentary, it is satisfying on many levels for the reader. At this stage, Goodkind has mastered his balance of the slow burn while meeting our desire for blood. The novel builds to a delightful crescendo, which in my opinion is not matched until perhaps the last novel in the series. It's a must read for fans, and a worthwhile standalone book for anyone who enjoys a good story.
__label__2 VDC 1.33 amp Battery Maintainer / Conditioner: Excellent Product; does what it's advertised to do. Comes with lugs/rings and alligator(battery) clamps and a long cord. Works like a cell phone charger, just connect it & plug it in. WILL NOT WORK ON A COMPLETELY DEAD BATTERY!! (If the battery is dead, use your bulk charger to boost it for a couple of hours and then connect the maintainer.) Once the maintainer reaches full charge, it goes into conditioner mode (green flashing light)which is desulphating the battery, exentending its life. Worth the $$$. [...]
__label__2 Money saver: I chose to buy a modem as opposed to renting one from the cable company. Of course when the install tech realized I had my own he tried to pitch to me why it would be better to rent but it isn't his fault he has to upsell. I am happy with this modem and although cable dude tried to tell me this modem would limit me, I see no problems and speeds are just fine.
__label__1 A huge disappointment.: Iris Johansen has jumped into the arena of ludicrous conspiracy theories with a novel that constitutes neither a thriller or romantic suspense. It's just plain nutty, going beyond the realm of credibility into something that had me exclaiming out loud in disbelief. Common sense tells one that nothing in her plot could ever happen in real life. I know it's fiction, but unless it's science fiction, I like a little dose of reality in a plot. I sure didn't get any in this book. I used to be a big fan of Ms. Johansen, but her last three books have really strained my fondness for her writing. Suffice it to say I'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on.
__label__1 My Dad Like Them: I bought these for my Dad and he seems to enjoy them. It's difficult to determine if he's just saying that or if he really does though.
__label__1 Don't waste your money...: Because you'll need it when the baby gets here. You can learn everything else on the fly.
__label__1 Not as advertised: Bought these and there is no inner- valve to prevent leaks. I've not had to use it, so don't know how sturdy it will be. You would have to throw it away immediately after using it or hold it upright in your lap, because it will definitely leak! It is also clear rather than opaque and there was no packing slip, either. I'm a little scared to try this product after reading the other review. Giving it two stars, because I haven't had to actually use it, yet.
__label__2 some what of a lie: In this movie they strech the truth tis is what made me take off one star.So to find out how get off line and watch the movie!!
__label__1 Terrible is all I can say: Really that sums it up. So bad I had hard time watching it. And I usually greatly enjoy his movies. So sad.
__label__1 Disappointing: So sorry. Usually, I love this author but this novel was a major disappointment for me. Web, the main character was boring and the book way too long.
__label__1 Jordan has set a new standard for boring: Jordan unfortunately has sold out and it seems is only interested in the money. Another boring book that is tiresome reading, i'd say about the last 30 pages were worth reading. Whats next 700 pages on how the sea folk build ships. Someone e-mail me when the last book comes out, maybe in about 20 years. I'd ask for Jordan to e-mail me but I couldn't handle 600 pages of boring e-mail.
__label__2 Great story for my little guinea pig lover!: Such a cute story, and a great Valentine's gift for my little guinea pig lover. She went right to reading it when she opened it!
__label__1 This book was not for me: While reading Paddock's novel, I kept hoping it would get better. Sadly, it did not. Paddock began with a great premise for a story -- three girls brought together by a tragedy. However, poor narration, weak character development, and lack of actual story line made this book into the mess that it was. She tried to make the characters realistic, but was unable to develop them in a span of 15 years. She tried to intertwine three separate story lines in just over 200 pages, but wasn't able to do that either.I generally have a great appreciation for "chick lit" type books, but this was terrible. I didn't connect with the characters. The characters did not connect with each other. I think that Jennifer Paddock got lucky that her publisher liked this book, because I did not find much in this novel that would entice me to buy another one by her.
__label__2 One of my all time favorites: I had this album on a cassette that was copied from a album, needless to say, it lacked quality, but it still was my favorite album while I was growing up, and it sat right beside my early Metallica and Anthrax (along with Seals and Croft's Greatest Hits), sticking out like a sore thumb as most reviewers have said (except I am younger). I can't wait to get this version on CD, I've been listening to it online fom a download site all this time, but have decided to re-add it back into my collection. I've missed it sorely. Highly recommended for EVERYONE! Doesn't matter what genre you normally listen to, this album is THAT good! Cat's voice has a unique sound and I love his guitar style, powerful "happy music" (compared to the Pantera, Tool, and Megadeth I listen to now).
__label__1 mine quit too in less than a year: My daughter uses almost daily, and the first one lasted a month. Amazon was nice enough to replace it, but now that one has died 8 months later. I realize they don't last forever, but for that kind of money, I expect several years of use, and according to reviews, this appears to be a common problem.
__label__1 Absurd: There are so many things wrong with this book,I don't know where to start. First, the author sees himself as a scientist and writes like he is providing an article to Vanity Fair. Ignoring science, disregarding significant works and stating opinion as fact he proceeds to batter us with trivia while ignoring facts. I have no argument with the inability of IQ tests to accurately define human intelligence as it relates to practical capability. That doesn't mean, as one of the other reviewers mentioned, that the Bell Curve is not a significant book. Argue the rationale not simply state an opinion and walk away. This book is so plagued with bad science and silly extrapolations from 11,000 years ago that it ignores many of the realities of history. I'll stop now but I could go on for paragraphs.
__label__1 I love zombies but not this movie: Terrible movie, bad acting. I could not even watch the whole movie. I fell asleep it was so bad. Plot doesnt even make sense.
__label__1 Worthless Movie: This was the absolute worst movie I have seen in quite a long time. I only watched it because it had Bruce Willis in it. Why he did he do this movie (was he blackmailed? Did he have a stroke? Did he want to do one really absolutely bad movie before he died?) I do not know. I will be cautious about any of his movies in the future. An absolute waste of viewing time.
__label__2 Darker, But Very Satisfying!: This is an excellent read! The longest of Rowling's books so far, it is also darker, but very satisfying. Plot elements that have been working for the last four books are brought together. Not all questions are answered, and there is more mystery generated that will need to be cleared up in the next two books, but Book Five is very satisfying to read. I highly recommend it! Enjoy reading!
__label__1 Teaches preschoolers how to be an effective Bully: This story teaches children how to be bullies. It is not about sharing. The poor fish who was blessed with beautiful fins is ostracized by all the other little fish because he would not give them one of his fins. They called is sharing. They didn't want to share, they wanted his fins all for themselves, and when he wouldn't give them away, all the other fish refused to swim, play or interact with him. He was so lonely and sad that he relented and gave all but one of his fins away. If this isn't social bullying, I am not sure what is. The author and publisher should be ashamed for promoting such behavior to preshoolers. I received the book as a gift, read it and promptly threw it in the trash. And I am a book lover through and through, but this was trash. I wish I could rate it with a negative star.
__label__1 Confusing: Orlando Bloom plays a recently widowed blacksmith in France who is sought out by his father, Liam Neeson, a noble and a knight returning to the Crusades in Jerusalem. Orlando follows him, then inherits his estate after his untimely death. Suddenly, everyone is listening to this nobody from nowhere, and Orlando ends up heroically leading the army of Jerusalem. Huh?I guess movies like this about interesting historical periods are very hard to make. Look at Alexander and Troy. I thought I was conversant with the Crusades, having read a score of books about the period (specifically the fascinating Eleanor of Aquitaine), but found this murky movie impossible to follow.P.S. - Note to Ridley Scott: every cut does not spew blood like a geyser.
__label__2 Brother sewing machine: This is the smoothest running machine that i have ever had and it makes so many beautiful stitches. i am so happy with my purchase. Would definately recommend it to anyone. It is so easy to use.
__label__2 Brilliant and Layers of messages..: This movie is one of my all time favorite movies. I think that it so so much more then a love story. It's a life story and layered with so much rich, spiritual meaning that it's a movie you have to see more then one time to really soak it in. If you are looking for something brilliant, thought provoking and entertaining this is your movie!I know it did not get a lot of great reviews but I personally think the reason for this is that many people just don't get it. I urge you to open your mind and give it another chance.
__label__1 Short review: I found this a boring film. There was no new insight to the world of the adolescent. If you are a big fan of high school synchronized swimming teams, you may well enjoy the film.
__label__1 disappointed: I had heard great things about this movie while it was in the theaters... I pre-ordered it from Amazon, and couldn't wait to watch it. When I finally had the chance to do so this afternoon, I was completely let down. As with many other movies, the "funniest" parts were all shown in the previews & ads. I kept waiting for it to get to it's "side-busting" "laugh out loud!" parts... and it never got there. True, there are scenes that were funny, but overall, I wasn't thrilled. While I'm sad I paid $15 for this on Amazon, it's better than having paid $20 + food/drinks @ the theater.
__label__1 Despite the cover photo, it's Ashley-lite: Wow -- what happened between 'Hi, How Are You Today' and this CD? What a big change! From fast, rocking instrumentals (on the former CD) to songs where any instruments take a back seat to singing (on the latter). The first song on the CD starts off well, but then Ashley (?) starts singing...it's not that his voice is particularly bad, but the vocal tune just doesn't seem to go with the music the instruments are playing. As for the rest of the songs...well, I guess he did say he wanted to make a pop album. The vocals are the main focus -- vocals aren't what drew me to Ashley MacIsaac's music, and with this CD as an example, they won't keep me listening, either, unfortunately. They're not terrible, just...uninspired, I guess is the word.
__label__1 Deadly awful stuff, a sacrilege: Please note what I'm writing here applies only to Vol 1 of "The best of the Hee Haw Gospel Quarter." I haven't heard Vol 2.Some cretin, with the first volume, decided to add electric guitar and piano to all the cuts, and in the process of doing so, destroyed all the authenticity of what began as masterful renditions of traditional church music.Once upon a time I owned all the HHGQ albums --seems like there were at least six of them-- on cassette, and when they either wore out or were borrowed and never returned I bought Vol one of "The Best of..." I've seldom, if ever, been so disappointed in a music purchase. Doesn't deserve any stars at all, but Amazon insists on at least one.I gave the CD to my sister, who is not a particularly discerning listener, and to be honest, she loves it. But if you think Vol 1 of "The Best of the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet"represents what used to be played on the TV show, you'll be sadly mistaken.
__label__1 hard cover The Lion the Witch and the wardrobe: This Item was described as hard back It was not. I sent it back. I got a full refund. The book is good reading. I would recommend it. If you don't mind paperback buy it.
__label__2 Your Dog Will Love It!: Ordered this for my very active yellow lab who chews-up everything. And I mean everything! She has so much fun with the flying-cow toy...she even plays with it by herself, tossing it over her head. It's been several months now, and still intact. The average toy usually lasts a day, two at best, with Abby. Highly recommend for all these reasons.
__label__2 Great Product!: After doing a lot of research on iPod docks, I decided to go with this one after seeing all of the great reviews. It was a gift for my boyfriend's birthday. He has an iPod touch 1st generation, and there were no compatibility issues. Great design, great sound, great price!
__label__2 At last, definitive scientific evidence!: For anyone who has studied astrology in depth and been astounded by its accuracy, here is the book to show to your sceptical friends. This is a thorough examination of how each of the twelve signs fare in relation to marriage, study, employment, death, criminal activity and so on. The book provides abundant meaningful statistics and analyses these clearly and carefully. This text should be of particular interest to psychologists and scientists to broaden their minds or anyone who wants to understand their fellow man a bit better.Thankyou Mr Sachs. Highly Recommended .
__label__1 quilt: I have been following this particular artist since she first published her first quilt book. I enjoyed her other books and is a bit disappointed with this latest addition to her repertoire.
__label__2 Totally amazing!: I first heard of Wicked when I was in "The Wizard of Oz" at my school, and our director told us the basic plot line at one rehearsal. When I came home, I happened to see my sister's Wicked soundtrack lying around and decided to listen to a few songs my director had mentioned. Well, they were awesome, and I borrowed the soundtrack for a few days to learn all the songs. I printed out the lyrics from a website, and now I just go around singing them all day long! I'm going to NY this summer and I really hope to see Wicked, because I know it would be totally amazing to see these songs that I already think are awesome performed on Broadway!
__label__2 Total satisfaction anticipated and received.: I have long loved my previous Casio Databank that I received 24 years ago on our 40th wedding anniversary. I was overjoyed to find such a wonderfully updated replacement on Amazon. The watch is doing a great job of accommodating my programming efforts, and is functioning flawlessly. Thank you Amazon
__label__1 No definition of design: Working with hexagon and octagon pieces, you get a visual effect like the front cover of the book. I thought the quilts looked a mess and didn't have any definition of design in them. I suppose it would be fine for someone who actually likes this kind of quilting. Not my cup of tea.
__label__1 Maine Mama: My 17 month old has been real hot on these characters... so I ordered this video. It simply did not measure up to other Sesame Street videos we have bought. There are many others that are far more engaging. As likeable as Bert and Ernie are, I think this one is kind of a snoozer
__label__1 Wanted: New Vocalist for Decent Backing Band: The worst vocals I've ever heard. Makes Yoko Ono look like a songbird. Hire someone who can sing dudes!
__label__1 More like 2 1/2 stars: Well, this movie is worth seeing if there isn't anything better to see at the time. "Annie" has a GREAT performance, she can very well portray a small towner, and she is a good example of people who "make their own fun". It's an OK movie overall, but the last 5 min of the movie are worth seeing, so you might as well watch it for those 5 min.
__label__2 My Favorite: I have read a thousand books but never before have I read such a beautiful and touching story. I loved the characters as if they were my family, I even hated them at times for the same reason. The thing about this book that is so different from all the others I have read is the fact that it forever changed me. Dr. Larch's reasons for being prochoice became mine. It depeicts a world where such a right is denied in such a realistic fashion. It is honest with every word and gives such a variety of characters to relate to. If you only read one book in your lifetime, make it this one.
__label__2 Recommended highly: Both my girls were targets in middle school, as early as 5th grade, and when the school said they could do nothing, I happened upon this book. It was a life saver. After reading it, I could counsel my girls through their classroom situations with minimal assistance from teachers and administrators. My girls managed to learn the difference between good friends and cliques. A couple of years later, those same queen bees got out of hand and had to be disciplined for bullying and publishing a 'burn book.' Then, teachers came to me and asked for my secret. Over the years, I have given this book and title to many teachers and mothers.It's much better than the Ophelia books and a good companion to other teenage behavior and dating books. Can't say I've read the newer version, which includes the boyfriend bit.
__label__2 I like it!: Put one on my 2010 Xterra and I like it. It fits well and I cannot hear any rattling at all. I tightened up the anti-rattle device pretty tight. I got the black one to match up with the Night Armor of my truck. I got this because I hate the guys who park by feel!
__label__1 A Very simple watch!: This is a very comon wacth, nothing spectacular in it, nothing that people will note. I really dont like it.
__label__2 Music with some substance: The more I listen to the album, the more I like it. "Say Goodbye", "Are You With Me?", and "What Good Is It?" are standouts. It is nice to finally hear some music with substance.
__label__2 Good for Copycat dremel tools too: Works well with other Dremel copycat tools too! If you require a little extra pressure to drill, the unit tends to wobble right or left instead of holding steady in position. Up and down and other functions are very good.
__label__1 Roxette warmed over: There's no way around it: while I'm all for this shamelessly poppy sound and these splendid production values, Michael Mozart is Per Gessle without the melodic sense, and Martika is Marie Fredriksson without the range. If you like this one, I strongly encourage you to pick up Roxette's "Have a Nice Day."
__label__2 Important and telling: especially now when hurricane sandy has destroyed so many homes and lives, it is important to remember who planned what, how and why. This non-fiction book gives a blow by blow of how the developers acquired the land, who they worked with in government, and how inadequately it was developed. Homes without piping for gas or water lines-- and building bungalows in flood prone areas are just some of the issues explored.
__label__2 Cogent, informational review of alcoholism research: An excellent broad-spectrum coverage of topical alcohol-related research. I found very concise information about changes in American drinking patterns in by Hilton & Clark. I especially enjoyed the clear explanation of research methods used which, in other papers of epidemilogical research, is not as clear. Also, the chapter about social processes very helpful for understanding concepts related to primary prevention.
__label__2 Informative, thorough and helpful for the first-time mother.: This book was extremely helpful for me. It clearly outlines potential problems and allowed for quick identification of breastfeeding problems for both me and baby. One of the better more straight forward reference books.
__label__1 Evolution in the wrong direction: Thicke's first CD entitled Beautiful World was a great CD. Timeless in my opinion. I can understand his reasons for moving in the direction he did with this new CD; however, I just feel it lacks the rawness, hooks and tempo of his previous effort. His song writing skills are great, but this is not was I hoping for with this CD.
__label__1 Stopped working after first power outage: Not intuitive, have to use the book to figure out how to set it. It worked for the weekly test fine for several months and then stopped working. Battery backup is misleading, the duracells we put in must have charged and leaked while it was plugged in and we had to reset the thing numerous times. For the price this is pathetic. This is going in the trash and I won't be buying another product from Oregon Scientific again.
__label__2 my daughter is addicted: hi,I got this for my 2 year old daughter who was just not speaking besides saying 2-3 words. She instantly LOVED the video and follows along really well before this, anything that i would put on, she would get bored...it really does captivate the mind of your two year old... Her vocab has improved a little and what i really like is that they focus on sounds instead of words....like the sounds of vowels..a e i o u...and they also make different facial expressions that my daughter imitates right away...so i highly recommend it,... i just wish they had a VHS version *YES* i know because she keeps on opening the DD player and playing with the disc and has put scratches on it.
__label__1 cususinart pan: The Pan was a second it turned black as soon as I fried some poek chops. unforunatly I did not save the package for the prouduct. or register it so I am stuck with a pan I can not use. I also sent a message to cusinart to see if there had been a problem with this pan and did not recieve a answer back. very poor business from this company and I wll never buy another product from them. I have had a set of farberware for thirty years and the pans never changed. I needed this particular pan for a baking pan .
__label__2 fun, fun, fun: I watched the movie a few times on TV so I decided to add it to my DVD collection. It is a fun movie to watch.

__label__1 Nutritious but not so delicious.: These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland. Bland with a hint of cinnamon. I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive. On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories. A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor.
__label__1 A MAJOR ( PUN INTENDED) DISAPPOINTMENT: I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, " Inside the Ropes", as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize.
__label__1 amazed: I bought this book, because i'm a home baker who is trying to get a business going. So far the word of mouth has been great. I'm always trying to find new ideas, and I try to buy all the books I can on cakes. Well this one really amazed me. I found it hard to believe that this person is a professional. Her icing is all rough, her scale in decorations are wrong and her desings are, for lack of a better word...funky. I have to say that my cakes look more finished than hers, and I work from home. This book was amazing in that it opened my eyes and gave me hope to someday being a sought after cake designer.
__label__1 Ughhh!: I didn't care for this CD. I would never pay that much money for a CD, but I made an exception for this one. I regret it.
__label__2 One of Yearwood's Best: At first when listening to Trisha Yearwood's new cd, Real Live Woman, I had to adjust to the new sound. It is a very eclectic collection of music, but it is perhaps her best yet.Some of the best tracks are One Love, Sad Eyes, Real Live Woman, Wild For You Baby and When A Love Song Sings The Blues, although they are all really good.I highly reccomend this new cd by Trisha, go out and get it~
__label__1 AVOID! Fabric used is NOT what's listed in online description.: These socks are the worst. Apart from construction issues, the fabric that's used is significantly different to what's listed in the online production description.The online description lists: 84% combed cotton, 14% stretch nylon, and 2% spandex.The actual sock label lists: 79% cotton, 19% nylon, 1% polyester, and 1% spandex.And quite frankly, I have enough floor experience in garment production to doubt very much that the sock label is correct. It wouldn't be the first time a manufacturer conveniently "forgot" to make sure a label was updated to reflect downgrades in fabric quality.So sad to see a classic brand go down the tubes.
__label__2 Pretty Much the Best Ever: This product works Great. I am using a Logitech Harmony Xbox 360 remote and have never had a problem. I use it from about 20 feet away through 2 walls, with no problems. I would recommend that you get the eyes that go with it if you ant to control many components.
__label__2 Versatile, functional, good: It is simple the best bluetooth i've ever had. It pairs with my PDA and Laptop without any problem. Comes with car charger, USB charger, what else you could ask?
__label__1 an embarrassment to the acting and movie making community: We rented this movie to unwind after the long Christmas weekend. The writers, editors, filmaker, actors (and i use this term only as an adjective, for there are no actors in this movie)publisher and producers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this kind of sloppily finished product out for the public. Not only does it insult the average person's intelligence, it slams whats left of todays morals by their crude shock and awe language and images. Shame Shame Shame. It is pretty sad when one stoops this low to make a buck; at another's expense; giving nothing back, stealing what they can get. If I had read the reviews I would not have rented this trashed vulgar movie; the only good thing from it is the lesson i wont forget for a long long time, read the reviews before buying.
__label__2 No more pinched fingers: I finally broke down and bought a new set of hedge trimmers! My other ones were dull and if I wasn't careful, my fingers would get pinched. Naturally I looked to Fiskars for my best options. My shrubs have never looked so good!!! I think my husband is going to hide them from me as I can't stop using it! The grip is very comfortably. My fingers don't get pinched, and it is very sharp!
__label__2 Excellent for marriage and spiritual growth: Reading this devotional, I don't know which improved more--the depth of my marriage or the depth of my walk with God. Plowing through the dailiness of maintaining marital vows, I was reminded that our commitments at home (reinforced in Devotions for Sacred Parenting as well) are the venue for some of God's best refining work in our lives. The entries are a perfect length for a weekly devotional--although I often felt compelled to read ahead because of the quality of the original material the author produced for this book.
__label__2 Hello old friend!: I'm a practical person, so I have no idea why I stopped using Corelle over the past two decades, but I'm sure glad I came back to my old faithful. Corelle has never disappointed me and I recommend it to anybody. I guess I wanted to try other things, and after amassing all kind of heavy bulk which I eventually gave away, I resorted to buying disposable paper plates which, useless to say, got to be expensive after awhile. Corelle is better than disposable plates because they are light and easy to handle, they don't break, they are easy to clean either in the dishwasher or by hand, they are heat resistant, they hardly take up any space on the shelf or in the sink, and they are inexpensive to buy. I also think they are pretty as they come in a variety of colors and styles. Sure, I have my expensive china for special occasions, but for everyday use I'm definitely glad that I came back to Corelle.
__label__2 no ball stoppage at all: this is a great add on for the 98 custom. it allows you to shoot very fast and it feeds all the balls with out any blank shots. i know i love it
__label__2 good LCD choice.: The quality is pretty good, slim design. looks no difference with 171B, the contrast rate is a bit lower for a 17 LCD but the text and figure looks clear and sharp enough. The best thing is the price. At this price this one is really a good deal.
__label__2 Definintely decrease your migraines: I have suffered from migraines since I was nine years old. I am now 42. A nurse at my doctor's office recommended this a couple years ago. I use it nearly every day. It has drastically reduced my migraine attacks. When they do hit they are not as severe. Please try this before resorting to Topomax as I did. This has no flavor and no side effects. Awesome product!!!! Definitely worth a try. It took me about two bottles to notice the difference.
__label__1 From the left: Mr. Isaacson seems to come from the left. After reading John Adams by David McCullough, I considered Adams an American hero. McCullough did as well, having begun a biography on both Jefferson and Adams and continuing only with Adams, finding him a much fuller character. However, Isaacson has nothing but disparagement for Adams. He considers him a Puritannical figure who just made life difficult for Franklin, the most tolerant of men. He seems to much prefer Franklin's brand of morality to Adams'. There's either balance or good judment missing, I believe.
__label__1 disappointing: Man this CD [is bad]. Too many superficial tracks; Playa Hater, Effin You Tonight, Another. No songs with meaning. Get something different like Makaveli the 7 Day Theory.
__label__1 Not worth the pricetag: I was really looking forward to trying this pillow out, and had heard good things from other expectant mothers. However, I was extremely dissapointed after trying it out. As someone else said, the pillow isn't long enough. I'm 5'7" and my head would hang off the end, so I'd need another pillow to support my head. There's not a lot of fill in the pillow itself, which made me feel less supported, not more. And it made shifting positions during the night downright impossible.I wish I would have gotten a big fluffy body pillow for half the price instead.
__label__2 BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!: All 3 of the Harry Potter books are great. They are so enjoyable to read with the family. If you think these books are bad in a way that they show violence then you are wrong. I would recommend these books to all ages!
__label__2 It's OK: ConsIt gets boring after a wihle and you can earn neopoints, but it's like a pollypocket but neopets.ProsYou can take it anywhere on the go , and it's farieworld AWSOME
__label__1 Earlier was better: I have so enjoyed Miss Owens' songs. "Own Me" is a particular favorite. This albumn just didn't click with me...
__label__1 blow out the candle: I'm sorry to say that this is a sure-fire flop CD. And, listen, I was a fan, but I've got to give an honest review. This music is so sappy that it's embarrassing to listen to -- unless you're a 15yr old girl (and hey, maybe that's their market now). I couldn't even get through the entire CD twice! Where's the punch and anger that drove their 1st CD? I wasn't expecting grunge (we all know that that's dead), but these songs have absolutely zero edge. The writing is silly and rehashed, and is reminiscent of the late 80s post-glamrock ballad frenzy (ever heard of Tesla?). And they actually had the nerve to thank RUSH in the liner-notes -- are you guys kidding me?!
__label__1 cantankerous pedometer: I bought this pedometer a week ago from another retailer. It is very difficult to program, and the directions are poorly written. So, I am on line shopping for another model.
__label__2 Great Kihoalu!: Ledward is a master slack key player and plays some classics on this album. He is at his peak and his music will bring a warm tropical breeze to your mood.
__label__1 Bad science, intolerable to read - good messsage: This book is chock full of bad science and shoddy reasoning. I agree with the basic message that we need to re-examine our cultural assumptions to survive as a species, long term. This is hardly earth-shattering news to anyone with a brain. But, the irritating main character in the book rolls out falsehoods and wild speculations as obvious fact - and the even more irritating secondary character can only reply "Oh I was so stupid now I see you are right about everything". Rush Limbaugh would have a field day with this book. It shouts "I'm a wacko hippie freak - kick me!" This book is a disservice to environmentalists everywhere.
__label__2 Pretty "Good": I enjoyed this book. It was exectly what I expected, a little bit of insight, a little bit of instruction and a little bit of personal observation.It is a great book for any new coach or someone looking to get some ideas, but it wont make you a better coach or change your life.
__label__2 My favorite album from Tommy Victor and Company: This album, and let alone, the band prong were way ahead of the curve in the metal circle, much like Helmet and other New York early 90's bands. This album sounded much Like "Nu-Metal" before "Nu Metal" was ever thought of. With great songs like Who's fist is this Anyway and Snap your finger, snap your neck, only now is the power and influence of this record fully being realized, and being re-vitalized by college stations across the nation. Other tracks that get your fist pounding and blood pumping are One outnumbered and Not of this Earth. This is a strong album from start to finish, and if you had one prong album to choose, I would start with this one for light listners. Personally, this is within my "top ten if stranded" collection. Check this album out, if you like metal/industial crunching sound, then this will be right up your alley. Highly recommended!!!
__label__1 Premise is flawed and dated: The author is on the bandwagon that a MFA is the degree of the future and that we can protect our jobs from being automated or offshored by learning to Design Beauty, Tell Stories, Compose Symphony, Show Empathy, Plan, and find Meaning. One of his foundational examples is a quote from GM that they are a design company that happens to make cars. While that was a great argument in 2004, they are also a failed company that required a government bailout. Overall, it is an interesting and thought provoking book, even if I do disagree with his conclusions.
__label__1 It fell apart with my daughter in it: This bassinet was a waste of money. After tax and shipping it cost over $100. I registered online and did not see it in person. From the moment I put it together it did not live up to my expectations. It does NOT have lights, sound, or vibrations. But the worst part was that it was falling apart from the beginning. It started with one wheel that always fell apart when it was moved, then another wheel. Then, a little while later it became very whobbly. Then, one night, with my 2 month old daughter inside, the frame completly fell to pieces. Thankfully, the top part where my daughter was sleeping is seperate and just fell flat on the ground. If you are looking for a crade or bassinet, I would not choose this one. I have seen countless other cradles that are cuter, and of better quality, and even cheaper, that I wish I could have gotten, but I've already wasted my money on this one.
__label__2 Does what they're supposed to.: Standard chrome-plated tin cutters. If you make sandwich rolls or doughnuts, the large cutter is a must.
__label__1 A Jazzed Up Version of "This Time Of the Year": I looked for a long time for the song...This Time of the Year. When I orderd this CD, there was no mention of this song being sung in a jazzed up version of the original classic. I was extremely disappointed and never listen to this CD. I did email (twice) explaining my dissapointment. No refund was offered.I finally found another site where I could purchase the song. The person sent me both the CD and the single and in addition to that, sent a sound bite to be sure he had the version I wanted. He did and I'm thrilled with the original recording.
__label__2 Very good text book: This book is a very good text book. I have just recently needed it and just started to use it. As far as I have gotten it is easy to read. The only thing that I don't think that I like about it is that it is black and white. If you want to get the full feeling for the achitecture I would think one might need to see it in color but oh well.
__label__1 a poor introduction: If I can save anyone the pain of using this book I would like to do it. This was used for my undergraduate course in mathematical statistics (the first statistics course for me). Fortunately, I had an excellent professor, and was able to learn the material from him and from other texts. Rice is extraordinarily difficult to understand. There are many examples of poor English with ambiguous sentences, algebraic errors, failure to emphasize or sometimes even to explain or define essential concepts, and obtuse end-of-chapter problems. In order to learn the material, I made use of several other textbooks, including Hogg & Craig and Bain & Englehart. Both of these books, in fact EVERY one of the ten or so books I used, was far better than Rice.
__label__1 poor reception: The Terk AM/FM Amplified Stereo Antenna with Gamma Loop may work in some places but it didn't work up state AZ in the mountians. It pulled in only those stations I could get before I plugged in the Terk. Sorry. I have since sold it.
__label__1 Can't even SCAN if it thinks an ink cartridge is low: Honestly, I would love this printer except for the one bugaboo, and it's huge one. The printer tries to track ink usage, but doesn't do so accurately. Then, once it "thinks" you may have a low ink cartridge, it stops working altogether until you pony up the money to replace the allegedly low ink cartridge. The issue is that the cartridge may not actually be low. An even bigger issue is you can't SCAN, or do anything else until you pay up. Why do I have to have 6 full ink cartridges to SCAN a picture? (By the way, you can't print in black and white either.)I will never buy another Epson product because of this foolishness. I can't afford to keep SIX cartridges full ALL the time, leaving this otherwise very nice piece of equipment useless to me until I can come up with the $70 plus to replace the cartridges . . . over and over again.
__label__1 Sad excuse for music: Kid Rock is not a musician, he IS an entertainer, if you want to hear musical talent, buy Led Zeppelin, most of the stuff on this CD is decently written, but he can't sing, and while it may be popular now, in about 5 years or less, nobody will remember Kid Rock. So if you want to be popular, buy it, but if you want to hear real music, look somewhere else.
__label__2 Useful Menu/Cookbook: This was useful to me in that it offered me simple ideas for Breakfast, Meal, snack etc. along with recipes.The only thing that I did not like was that it is an older version of WeightWatchers book and did not have the points for each menu but I was able to figure.This cookbook was more like an all in one book.But overall, I use this cookbook more that I use the newer Weightwatchers Cookbooks.
__label__2 Excited About Learning: This is one of the best classes I have ever taken. I enjoyed Ellie's class so much that I have enrolled in her next class given at the Board, which is proofreading. She is a wonderful instructor. Thanks Ellie.
__label__1 Skip this one!: I generally really enjoy Evanovich's books - I love the Plum series and have read every single one. Having finished all of those, I moved on to the Full Series hoping to read some more fun Janet novels. The first three Fulls were ok but this one was so bad! How does Abby end up with Wes? I have no idea because the guy is a complete stranger but all of a sudden she trusts him and is in love with him?! She believes he is a photographer but she allows him to get mixed up with her husband's murder investigation?! The rest of the characters and story are slightly entertaining but the love story really lost me. It just didn't seem authentic to the story.
__label__1 Too stiff: I didn't care for this dishwashing brush. The bristles were so stiff, I had trouble getting it into the corners and grooves of square pans and bakeware. I am keeping it, though, to clean other items that need a good stiff brush (grill, etc.)
__label__2 Beautiful & functional kettle: My husband was always burning up our kettles, so I decided to try the Aroma electric kettle. It's beautiful and boils water in a jiffy. I'm very please that I don't need to worry about a dangling cord; and the handle is nice and sturdy. This is a great kettle -- love the way it looks and works, so far!
__label__1 Bad formatting on free version: I downloaded the free version and the formatting is very poor. I don't understand why there is no table of contents.
__label__2 GREAT!!!: I own this book and I enjoy using it, So I told a friend of mine about it.She was very interested in getting one, I surprised her with it and another book.She was very happy.
__label__2 An inspiring look into the life of our 26th President.: A very inspiring and thoughtful book of Theodore Roosevelt, the tradgedies and triumphs. Dealing with asthma as a boy, the care of a devoted father which he would try to measure up to all his life, the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day. This book is about Theodore's life and rise to power as the most powerful and beloved man on the Earth at that time, the building of the Navy, the Panama Canal, the National Parks saving millions of acres of woodlands and marshes and animals. Just the type of leader we need now, truly a must read.
__label__1 Best Fitness Video of 2010!!!!!: Bipasha Basu is a great actress. And this workout video is sure to help many. She explains each exercise patiently and demonstrates both the easy and the hard version. She will be releasing her Dance routine workout video in 2012 December, am sure it will add to our repertoire of workout DVDs and will instantly find a place of glory..Thank you! Bipasha!!!!
__label__2 Don't know why I waited so long: I've gone through 3 other extrude types before finally ordering the Atlas with motor and a few extra attachments. Absolutely love it! Makes the best handmade pasta ever. Simple to use and easier to clean!
__label__1 Olympus doesn't honor their warranty: The camera broke shortly after we purchased it. When we sent it in for repair we were told that our warranty was void because the camera had been dropped. The camera had not been dropped! So, not only was this camera a waste of money, so was the extended warranty because once Olympus voided the manufacturer's warranty the other was no good either. What a waste of money!
__label__2 shakespeare boogie: im 50 yrs old,ive got every southern album ever made,.38 special ,blackfoot,doc holliday,and all the obvious.i bought the first dbt albums more because of the name.....but this is the best southern album ever...its poetry with boogie beats...you gotta have it!
__label__1 Started off great, but.....: Just like the other review's....first the 1 button stopped working, followed by the 5 button...now the phone is useless. Very disappointing product from Motorola. Spend your money on something different.
__label__1 I can't believe it's this bad: I purchased this coffee maker with great expectations knowing Bunn is a well known coffee machine maker. The primary problem is the carafe. The carafe spills and drips everywhere, even when using the utmost of care. I am very disappointed and who designs this crap without trying it.
__label__1 Poor, poor, poor: Definitely the best looking of the PS2 remotes, which is why I bought it, but I ended up throwing it out after a few days. The mislabeled buttons were extremely annoying, the responsiveness of the buttons was terrible and I never managed to get the PS2 to recognize the controller when plugged into the Saitek pass-through port. Go for the Interact remote. It's a little bulkier, but at least it works.
__label__1 A Reader from Coeur d' Alene Idaho: I have just managed to get through this book, though it wasn't a noteworthy experience. Cornwell's tone throughout the book suggests grand arrogance and her deductions are based more on supposition than fact. The use of "may be," "could have been," "quite possibly," and a host of other statements of supposition are rampant in the book. To repeatedly refer to Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper in her unabashed tone--without more concrete evidence--could be potentially liablous. In fact, I would not be surprised if Sickerts family or estate took legal action against Cornwell.Cornwell is obviously out of her league when writing a book of this nature, and she should stick to what she appears to know best: fiction.Bottom line: From the literary point of view, the book drones on in a rambling manner. And, as stated, the facts don't match her conclusions. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 Good read.: Catches you right from the start - - so much so, I bought the next one in the series! You'll like it!
__label__1 Not worth the money: This potty seat is great for portability, however my daughter won't use it. The hinges where it unfolds pinch her bottom. I didn't have a problem the few times she used it with it fitting on the toilet or anything like that though. I saw a similar folding potty seat in the One Step Ahead catalog - it's padded, so it says it won't pinch. That might be something to consider instead.
__label__2 Amazing album: This album is definitely worth the money. I've listened to it a lot, and I continue to find new little surprises. These guys outdid themselves on this album, and it keeps getting better with every album they release.
__label__2 A Good Introduction To Bach and his ideas: I have never read Bach's works and this book gave me the oppotunity to learn what Bach is about. While I do wish he had gone into more character development, I understand why he had these limits. He discusses the imagination and obviously, this as insight into what he sees. I found this book thought prevoking instead of thought giving. He touched on areas and I put the book down to think about these areas in my own mind and life. I was not let down by this book and hope to read more of Bach's works. These works may show me more about him, but for mow, this book opened my mind and my world. I enjoyed it a lot!
__label__1 interesting little stories, in the long going nowhere: Each little scene is often interesting but if you're waiting and hoping that the whole thing comes together and makes some kind of sense, you'll be waiting a long time. For Kosinski, there are better choices...
__label__2 Buddy: Great recording, a few I haven't heard before are better than the more common hits I hear on the radio
__label__1 Where were the DVD extra features?: The movie was cute, but why bother with the DVD if they don't use the technology that's available. Luckily I had read an explanation about the Windex, so I was able to appreciate the humor there, but why no deleted scenes or other fun stuff? We were a bit disappointed.
__label__1 Extremely Superficial: I didn't find in this study guide, what I've expected (based on my experience with other study guides): (1)Precise explanations of the basic concepts, (2) Quizlets to test the important and hard to understand concepts, (3) Providing solid answers for the quizlets including the Why's and the Why Not's, (4)Concrete discussions of at least a few intricacies in each topic, (5)A thorough set of multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter, (6) A thorough explanation of the right and the wrong answers, (7)A Test Simulator CD, etc. The coverage of the topics and the multiple choice questions is "very sketchy."
__label__1 May pass for fiction: Very dissapointing. Description of book indicated a very serious look at Atlantis. But what I found was more of story based on fantasy. The descriptions of atlantean society architecture, and military were based (and then stretched) from descriptions from Cayce and telepathy with individuals who passed away 10,000 - 11,000 years ago. What little information that was based on historical records or modern research was weak (if not distorted).
__label__1 Don't collect this book: The forensic details were fascinating, but the storyline was hard to swallow. The characters were flat and the identity of the "unsub" was ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this book.
__label__2 Excellent family film: This film is a firm favourite with all our family. It's one even our 3 year old son will watch all the way through as well as our 8 year old daughter. It is a simple storyline children can follow but with lots of action and adventure - space, robots and flesh eating Zorgons who are about on the scary level as Dr Who villians. There is a very human element with siblings who fight like cat and dog in real life but pull together to survive through the Zathura board game experience. The older sister and the handsome astronaut give it a greater interest to younger teenagers too. My children find this more entertaining than Jumanji and it has just the right amount of suspense and mild terror to keep them hooked. The actors are great, the plot is very entertaining and the setting is fantastic. My children must have watched it at least 20 times and they still laugh when the bicycle falls out of the sky at the end. Well worth purchasing at less than 5.
__label__2 The best: Clint really played this part well. I loved how he made a big turn around from hating a race from the Korean war to befriending his korean neighbors.
__label__2 Great Resource: I'm homeschooling my high school child and find this to be a great lab resource for our Chemistry.
__label__2 An album full of ROCK MUSIC. Imagine that!: What a relief. I didn't think record labels pressed rock n' roll albums anymore. Well trust me, this album is rock. The first two tracks explode from your stereo. It's great! Insignifigance and Grievance are also great songs. Perhaps the highlight of the album is Eddie Vedder on ukelele! One warning though: Don't buy this album expecting to hear another Ten. This album is more in the vein of Yield. But it is not exactly the same, because once again Pearl Jam proves they can do the evolution.
__label__2 oh my god!: it was soooooo good. it was way worth the money you had to pay for it. i cried the first time i listened to it, and i still cry whenever i listen to it. the x-files has that effect on me. some of the songs were sad, and some were upbeat. my favorites were walking after you and hunter. invisible sun was good too! but, does anyone know which made it into the movie? i've watched it over 40 times, but i still don't know which made it into the movie other than walking after you. oh yeah, the remix of the theme is okay, but it's not nearly as good as the version they play on tv!
__label__1 Worked well, then died.: I had one of these for about 4 years, and it worked fairly well for that time. Then, last week, it abruptly died. It was on the "Keep Warm" setting when the lights suddenly went out, and the machine has not worked since. I have taken it apart to investigate, but I could not find anything wrong with it. My guess is that the wiring or circuits shorted out some place that is hard to see.As I said, it worked well for those 4 years, but I expect a decent appliance to last much longer than that.
__label__1 Not so much...: I ordered these for a new recipe I wanted to try. The recipe told me to butter the pan, put this down & then the cake. When the cake was done, cooled & friged overnight, I removed from the snap pan & the parchment was stuck to the cake. When I pulled it up slowly, cake chucks came with it. Not sure what I did wrong but I think I would have been better off not using the parchment. I will update my review if & when I use the parchment for another recipe.
__label__1 Second edition is disappointing.: There is almost no difference between the first and secondedition, regarding important security protocols. Mostly, keyagreement protocol chapter is deleted (We have to waitfor a second volume for this. But we don't know when thesecond volume will come out to the market-maybe 10 years fromnow...). Too many errors in the book. Too disappointed...
__label__2 the book I've been looking for: I have a keen interest in erotic spirituality and have done a lot of reading in that area. The Song of Songs is the best book of the Bible when it comes to readings about an erotic relationship with God. I've read several commentaries on the Song of Songs; but this book has been the most helpful. The author gives some helpful, non academic commentary verse by verse; but she also asks some experiential questions to help the reader not just think about the words in an cerebral way, but to actually "taste" the meaning of the words. She helps you enter into the Song of Songs in a prayerful way. It's a book for anyone who either does relate to God in a sensual way and/or would at least like to be open to the possibility.
__label__2 its working good and very good price: this battery working well and the price vrey good and i dont have any problem with itthanks
__label__2 NCIS: I loved this product. The packaging was perfect. The extras on the later seasons were wonderful. The only only negative part was that not all of the seasons had the play-all episodes capability. Other than that, it was perfect.
__label__1 Poor service: The parcel was left on my doorstep, directly at the side of a busy road, by the delivery service. Someone took, opened and discarded it further up the road. My neighbour found it and kindly returned it to me. An example of a shoddy service and inexcusable.
__label__2 The best..: This could be one of the best CDs to come out this year. This is so much better than 50 cent or banks Cd hands down.
__label__1 What a piece of junk!!!!: BUYER BEWARE!!!!Just because Roxio came out with a new version of their software doesn't mean it's either better, or even as good as the older version.I bought this to replace version 6 and am I sorry. It constantly crashed in Xp, and when it worked for more than a minute, the results were so poor, they were unacceptable (tried creating slideshows and they were so soft it was embarrasing).Finally, when I uninstalled the program, it completely trashed my OS and I was ultimatly forced to RE-INSTALL THE OPERATING SYSTEM.When you see this many negative reviews for a product, LISTEN! Thanks to Amazon for taking this pos back- it's the last Roxio/Sonic product I'll ever buy.
__label__1 PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack): It was made to look like it went with the Remote Dog Training Collar I ordered but doesn't seem be be related to it at all.
__label__1 Not for Me: What a disappointment. After reading the reviews I expected so much more. I did not hear much of a musical soundtrack or any rich orchestration. This was not for me it wasn't restful or soothing. I get better sleep results listening to soft music that, to me, makes sense and is calming. I do not like this brainwave entertainment.
__label__1 DON'T FALL FOR IT...: If I could rate this a negative number, I would. I purchased this plan with a Canon Powershot camera. I have had this plan and the camera for just over a year and the camera has been great. I had hope to never have to use this plan but unfortunately it couldn't handle a trip in my backpack. I just returned from a vacation and pulled my camera out of my back and at some point it was apparently bumped and the screen got cracked and is no longer usable. With that being said, I tried to call up this "good ol'" warranty and get the camera fixed...guess what...a cracked screen is not covered...of course not, why would it be. A long story short, don't waste your money on this warranty...$70 down the drain.
__label__1 Average at best: Dpn't be fooled by the Riedel name on these. These glasses are average at best, nothing like Riedels higher end lines. Definitely a 'name cheapening' product. Splurge for the Vinum line - you won't be disappointed.
__label__1 Too much interference: I live in Southern California and gave this product a good try, adjusting everything I could to get good sound. I wanted this to work. (I have a 2002 Subaru Outback VDC with a McIntosh sound system.) There was way too much interference. In the quieter parts of music I could hear static, and in the louder parts the sound was muddy.
__label__2 Josh's Best: Another wonderful CD by Josh. This so far is my favorite. I recommend it to anyone who loves this man's voice. I do.
__label__1 Horrible Camera: this is a horrible product. feels very cheaply made, takes horrible photos, and interface is strange and confusing.
__label__1 Might be scary for a little one: Before my 2 year old saw this video she loved Telly. Now, she tells me multiple times a day that she doesn't like Telly or "the triangle of destiny." While I thought the video was creative and quite entertaining for a kids movie, I think it scared her. We're going to put it away for a few months and see if she outgrows her fear.
__label__1 Horrible Horrible: This dude is the most unoriginal thief of all time. In the comedy world Menstealia is the equivalent of a grapefruit to the fruit world. He's trying to copy the delicious orange but falls amazingly short. Too bad none of the comedians he's ripped off over the years don't get a cut of the comedy central money he received for this abomination.
__label__2 Great system: With great graphics and awesome games. Game cube will most likey emerge the winner in the console wars
__label__2 my 4 year old is starting to read!!!!: The rods are a great fun tool to learn reading and also helps with hand eye motor skills when the child snaps the rods together. The rods join from left to right only, teaching to read from left page.
__label__1 The Movie ain't that great either...: I feel the fanboy pain on the extras issue, but the movie is a major letdown after the first one. Why? Well, the CGI is so ubiquitous and intrusive, the purity of the cel animation of the first film is totally overshadowed. The mix of ultra-real computer animation and flat cel animation totally takes you out of the story. You get the impression the film makers were so taken with the possiblities of CGI, the plot was totally lost. There are the kind of beautiful and poetic moments you expect from a GITS flick, but the storyline is hard to follow and the surrealist detour the film takes in the second act is pretty and all, but way too showy and distracting. To make sure I wasn't just being cranky, I watched the first one again and my initial opinion was confirmed. And if you're expecting extras, you'll be let down on that count as well. Still, bad GITS is better than a lot of the Anime out there, so you may want to pick it up. Just don't expect too much.
__label__2 Victorious Woman: This is a book I would recommend for any woman to read, and especially women in difficult life situations. Annemarie Kelly has shared true accounts of women who have overcome difficult situations and has provided a resource that can be used as a means of support and encouragement. I picked this book up for that reason, and it's one I would buy as a gift for a friend rather than just loaning my copy out.Kelly herself is a victorious woman, not only as an author but also as a motivational speaker and advocate for women. If you haven't visited her website at www.victoriouswoman.com, you should take the time to do that as well.Shannon Albertson AmyEditor
__label__1 Worst Module Ever: I have recently been filling in some gaps in my classic module collection.This one really is not worth owning. Bad plot, stupid encounters and bizarre text. The PC characters provided (who you really have to use since the entire module is coded around them) have great names like Blondie, Slim and Blaze. There is boxed dialogue where NPCs say things like, 'Gee Whiz.' and 'Golly.'I have nearly all the classic modules and this one is one of the worst. If you are looking to complete your own collection, save this one til last!
__label__2 OMG memories: I was about 7 when these songs were out and i have so many memories from them. wow! i wish i was 7 again. stayin out late, hittin the boys water fights, &crushes. dang time flies.
__label__1 What a cockamamie story!: This is one of the most ludicrous books I've ever read. Robert Ludlum must need the money badly to trot out this old nag again.
__label__2 The magician's nephew...: This is my favorite book in the the chronicles of narnia series. This is abridged but so much fun for the little ones to listen to. The drama effect brings it to life.
__label__2 You'll Never Use Minute Rice Again!: I hate cooking rice. No matter how hard I try I always under or overcook it. Boil overs on the stove or microwave drove me nuts. I got this for Christmas from my hubby and I LOVE IT! Not only does it cook rice, it can make soups, stews, cakes, and more! I love being able to just measure my rice, hit start, and I get a PERFECT batch every time! After it finishes cooking, it kicks over to "Keep Warm" mode so while I am preparing my main dish my rice stays fresh and warm and will remain that way throughout dinner to allow people to grab seconds! This is by far the coolest kitchen gadget I own!
__label__2 Absolutely amazing stuff.. Open your mind before you proceed: How open is your mind? Read the book from word to word and make up your mind at the end of it. Do not stop mid-way and jump into conclusion. All the Nine Dimensions World mentioned are inter-related and you need to have a complete picture. If you believe what's written in the book, you will develop a new perspective of life that makes your current living absolutely worry-free and you will begin to enjoy what you have - regardless of what it is - there is no good or bad, it is your mind that determines it.. not the "it".
__label__1 Jane has miles and miles to go before she can become great: Son, son Jnae has a long way to go before reaching greatness. Her journey has just begun and there is so much distance to be covered before the end.I think Jane has a lot of potential, but there is a lot of experiments that she will need to make over the next few years. She will need to get her feet wet with real life situations. To truely understand these torch songs, requires more than just a good voice. These songs require having a lot of hurt and pain in your life.Let's just sit back and look a Jane over the next several years and see if she doesn't get better with age. Maybe she will and maybe she won't. We'll just have to wait and see!
__label__2 A great fitting: This Bras as a great fitting ,the only problem it's that they don't make it on size 34 .It would be fantastic to be able to have it in size 34 D
__label__1 Disappointed: I used an "old" Foley food mill for years and when it finally wore out I was excited to replace it with this new stainless steel one. I have used it a few times and am very disappointed in its performance. It does not grind as close and so leaves a lot of residue behind that should be in the applesauce. I takes more elbow grease to try to complete the job. I hunted around and found another "old" one and am much happier with that than with the new one.Mirro 50025 Foley 3.5-Quart Stainless Steel Food Mill Cookware, Silver
__label__1 not what I recalled: I must've been mistaken about this band, because I recalled hearing something beautiful from them. But this was a dud. Nice cover though.
__label__2 Sit down and listen: This is a masterpiece. I encourage the young to venture into the amazing musical poetry of "The Gates of Delirium." There is a history of rock music and this is a must. Keep enjoying the new stuff that's out there, but dig into the past. It may become your future....
__label__1 LOW VOLUME: Dear users,I was thrilled with the option of getting my hands on a pair of the renowned Sennheiser PC-66 headphones, but before ordering, I researched the internet and found once and again that the volume was very low using the USB connection even at maximum settings. As a thorough buyer I emailed Sennheiser tech support regarding this problem before buying and they replied that it was a non issue and that I would have no problems.Well I did have problems and even after tweaking everything that can be tweaked the volume is inappropriately low to listen to music pleasurably.I had to return the headsets to the retailer and lose $20 attributed to re-stocking fees. I did inform Sennheiset regarding the deceptive information and they really have ducked the issue.Don't buy these headphones.
__label__2 Pretty good, but...: First of all I must say that I really, really liked this book until about page 560. Then everything just sort of went downhill from there. The ending simply wasn't very satisfying. I also really hated the way that Lawhead would write about someone or something that sounds very important and then just forget about them/it.For example: the dream that Aidan has about the amir cutting his(aidan's) tongue out. What was the meaning of writing about that? I kept expecting the amir to betray Adian and start cutting, but he never does.But all of that aside, the story is very exciting and has a good mix of action, romance, intrigue, fantasy, and moral messages. And unlike some of Lawhead's other novels (namely Taliesin), this is fast paced and hard to put down.So I must conclude that although it has it's flaws, Byzantium is an example of truly great epic storytelling.
__label__2 Great piece of wood for the money.: I'll be the first to admit that my expectations weren't very high for this piece of mopani with such an affordable price, but when the piece arrived at my home I was truly blown away. The piece was about the same shape as the stock photo for the product. The only real difference was the limbs were a bit longer. Buyer beware that mopani produces a lot of tannin acid, but this can easily be controlled by treating the wood properly before introducing it to your aquarium. Plus tannin acid is actually good for fish and a known anti fungal. After introducing new wood to your aquarium don't be surprised to if you get a white fuzzy growth covering the wood, this I believe is a harmless bacteria that will resolve on its own within a few weeks and good aquarium maintenance. To wrap it all up if you looking for a good piece of wood for your aquarium this product will not disappoint.
__label__1 Serves its purpose: I began years ago with Silver's books. Today, I don't refer back to them...well...ever. They lack the depth, or the 'meat' of Wicca as it were. I would still recommend this book to a beginner because it offers a light and easy jumping off point for someone who knows little or nothing about Wicca. I personally enjoy hearing more about a persons life experience since that tends to be unique, individual and allows me to step back and look at my own life. Silver definitely offers a lot of insight into her own experience.But I would suggest that after you've read and understood her points, and if you find yourself truly interested and looking to learn more in depth, you will shelve this book and probably never pick it up again.
__label__2 Beautiful screen and loads of memory: Finally a Pocket PC to please the geekiest of the geeks. With the patch provided by a kind programmer, the e805 can display VGA (640x480) in native mode, and the results are stunning. Webpages and especially Excel will look tiny, but I never use Excel on Pocket PC anyway, so to me that complaint is moot. (Obviously if you do use Excel on your PDA this is important to know.) In addition to the great screen, I also love the 805's speed, memory and built-in wi-fi. Let's not kid ourselves: this is a high-end PDA and not everyone will find it a good value. But if you want VGA, this is the only game in town, and it's a good game.
__label__2 Excellent Introduction: I am not Mormon but I wanted to learn as much as I could about the LDS faith in as short a period of time as possilbe. I read the book in two days and found the information I was looking for. It is an excellent introduction to a truly great faith. The lifestyle is too restrictive for me but I can see the benefit and reasoning behind it. My only real complaints about LDS beliefs is the churchs positon on breeding and tithing 10%. Over population is a serious problem and it does not help the environment for people to have seven, eight or nine children even if they can afford it. But I really like the LDS emphasis on family and family values. I support Mitt Romney as President and will gladly argue with anyone that his faith is not a reason to vote against him. This book has given me some useful knowlege to use in support of that cause.
__label__2 Steam Generator Iron: Iron arrived promptly and in good condition. So far, it works as expected. I have had the Rowenta Steam Generator before and this iron works just as well. So far so good. I hope it lasts as long as or longer than the Rowenta which was 4 years.
__label__2 really cute: my husband entertains the geriatric population and they just love this little guy. real cute and friendly looking. good price.
__label__2 Honest and True: When have I ever been invited so completely into a writer's life? Could I be so candid? Are the things I have learned so worth sharing?Toinette Lippe offers up to us the events and reflections of a life lived by choice and with attention. It is a spiritual book of the most subtle kind, steeped in wisdom and yet as familiar as if this life being described were our own. Granted, portions of Toinette's life may not seem so ordinary, but in the next paragraph she reveals her experience of those same questions and dilemmas that touch us all, followed by a level-headed approach to looking at the facts without flinching or fantasizing. If we should choose to heed Toinette's musings, NOTHING LEFT OVER is a delightful recipe for making our own life a life well-lived.
__label__2 A wonderful book: This was a great book, about a girl who lives with her grandmother, aunts, and her great aunts. At her grandmother's house tea is served promptly at four o'clock, along with storytime. Everybody has a story at grandmother's house, with a begining, middle, and an end: except Grayling her story doesn't have an end, that she (or any one else for that matter) knows of. Grayling's story is lived as you read this book. This book has everything: family, friendship, and love. This was a great book that all of my friends and I have loved for years, and we all recomend it to you.
__label__1 cheap: wheel cover looked great when i got it- but when i tried to install it on my 2005 honda cr-v it came apart at the seams- not sewn together properly
__label__2 Nothing beats Olay for price and results.: Since I'm headed on to my seventh decade of life, I've been trying hard not to make that look too obvious. Olay products definitely have helped to keep my skin moisturized and excessive wrinkling at bay. This is my must-apply before bed, especially around the mouth, eyes, forehead and neck. Daytime must-apply isOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces. I love them both and get lots of compliments on my skin. Not bad for an older lady!
__label__2 Often surprising: I like the heroine's chutzpah in this story.... She's well-matched against her hero. It's fun to see him narrowing his focus on her while she boldly pushes him away.The aunt's romantic subplot seemed rather quick; it would have been nice if it had been developed more. And the brother's was thrown on, clashing uncomfortably with the rest of the book and involving some improbable events. Poor brother! His sister makes all kinds of decisions that should have been his. No, I think the brother needed a little more work in this. He needed to be more than just a Gimmick.But the clash between hero and heroine are what make this book quite enjoyable. Two great egos flail at each other and stir up a whole bunch of sparks, both of anger and of romance. I look forward to reading more by the author.
__label__2 Thank you Hank for exposing these heretics: It is about time that the evangelical establishment criticizes the unbiblical antics and false doctrines of the Toronto Blessing crowd. After reading this book, your will gain greater sense of discernment between "wheat and chaff". You will gain knowledge about the hucksters in the charismatic movement who have been preying on and destroying souls since the 1960s. Learn about the documented heresies of William Branham and the alcoholism of A.A. Allen. Also learn about the use of mesmerism and psychosematic manipulation in Pentecostal and Charismatic so-called revival meetings. Learn about the decline in the moral climate despite these revival meetings. Most shockingly, learn about the rampant anti-intellectualism of most of the leaders of the Toronto Blessing movement. Read this book and let the scales fall from your eyes!
__label__2 Not a history book but a scrapbook: Their passports, personal photos, and names -- all that remains of the over 11,000 French children carried off to the camps. This book is fragile, printed on thin paper with a delicate spine, and it is also has the strongest presence of any book I have ever read. The sheer impact of all of those young children cannot help but make the strongest among us feel sadness and loss. Much praise must go to the authors for putting so much time and effort into so many that have been forgotten.
__label__1 yikes :(: IT was a nice TV, I have had this TV for under 2 years, and well more of the same theme as i have been reading, one day the video mode would start switching, then cable company remote would no longer power the unit on, dispite reprogramming it. The it produced to when powering the unit on would only give a little blue light and about 10 minutes later the TV would come one. After doing very little research, I found there was not point in calling Westinghouse and I am guessing they resolved the issue by ignoring it and pulling the TV offf the market. I know when you buy a cheaper TV you get what you pay for, but this is inexcusable.
__label__1 Sleeper in Seattle: This book provides limited facts that are not already available in the newspaper. The writing style is monotone and does not compel the reader - definitely not something that will keep me up at night reading.
__label__2 Great reading: I read this book three years ago, and someone who borrowed it never returned it. I had to buy it again, and read it to make sure I don't miss anything. Deep, but explained in a way that makes it very easy to understand.
__label__1 Amazon has this product mislabled - the word "licorice" is wrong: Twizzler does not use the word "licorice" anywhere on the packaging for this product, because there is no licorice in the ingredients, and it does not taste like licorice. They are simply called "twists".
__label__1 Bad item: Purchased this to saved about $4.00, big mistake...the Velcro to fasten the other part of the other Velcro is very cheap and it will rip easily after a couple of uses...this brand is not good quality and I would not recommend anyone to buy this.. I went at my local sport store after I purchased this and the one at my local store cost $10.00 but it's a much better item that can last 20 times more.
__label__2 I love this thing!: I have read the other reviews (and did before I bought mine), but I also have friends who have owned these and never had trouble. Mine has operated very well for the past 7 months without a hitch. I use it daily, as a complete tea addict and caffeine hound. It heats a full kettle of water in about 3 or 4 minutes and the kettle itself is simple and tasteful enough to bring out of the kitchen to refill teacups with hot water for guests. As opposed to many of those short, fat little bulbous kettles that don't suit anyone's decore.Perhaps there was a bad batch of these and I'm the only one that got lucky? Who knows, but I would buy it again in a minute.
__label__2 big sid bling in 'nawlins not 'bout it: big ups to massa p for this golden ghetto fabulous masterpiece, chronicling his rise to fame from the streets (this must not be a true story because they left out the scene where p sells his soul to the devil so that people will buy and actually listen to his horrible, horrible music (and i stress horrible). i liked alot about this movie. i didn't so much like the bad acting, the bad camera shots/angles, the plot (i use the term loosely), the passing script that was probably written on napkins as filming went along, or the glorification of violence and abuse to women. no, i liked the underlying theme of homoeroticism between p and his boyz. you could tell that in all of their b-boy posturing there was a real sense of longing and desire to express their physical attraction for one another in the hot, sweaty, dirty south. if they would have centered the movie around that i would have definitely been more 'bout it.
__label__1 universal rf 20 review: I still have my remotes lined up on the coffee table after buying this "universal" remote. I was able to progarm most of the buttons, but it just wouldn't work for particular buttons on my Comcast digital remote. The up/down buttons and for some weird reason the number five for example. Tech support said I was doing it right, but to just "keep trying." Needless to say I'm now looking for another remote after having wasted my money on this one.
__label__1 Stick With The Original Thriller Release: As THE biggest Michael Jackson/The Jacksons/Jackson 5 fan EVER I am disappointed at the treatment Akon, will.i.am, Fergie, and Kanye gave these classic songs. They took a million carat diamond and turned it into a cubic zirconia. Perfection never should have been messed with. Their visions for and performance of the songs just did not work...at all. The only bright spot to this 25th Anniversary edition is the inclusion of the unreleased track "For All Time." For true fans, please stick to the original copy of the World's Best Selling Album of All Time!!!!! This one is not worth your money.
__label__2 cheap book!: the price on this book is well worth it. i'm a beginner and the book & cd's are great. i can easily follow along and learn the notes and chords. i especially like that there are tracks from the cd to reinforce my learning of the notes and chords.
__label__2 First They killed My Father: it was very good i liked how she should how everything was in her words that she used
__label__1 Avoid this Garbage at all cost!: shot on a handheld Video camera with bad Jazz music in the backround, this useless waste of time should be avoided!The entire "911" segment (barely) focuses on one ugly 911 turbo from 1979. The camera work is hillarious, shot most likely by someone with a bad hangover, you can see the cameraman's reflection in the paint, glass, and most of the rim shots.What a horrible waste of money!DO NOT BUY!
__label__1 Struggle to Finish!!: Liar's Game was a struggle for me to finish. The author was repetitive on how Dana felt about Vince's relationship with ex-wife and daughter, as well as how Vince felt about them. Dana was a selfish soul, who did not want a man with children (bottom line). Personally, I feel that with the drama Vince and Dana went through, they both needed to close this chapter in their lives and go their separate ways. (Call it a TKO!!) However, I was not surprised by the outcome, typical EJD style. Not your best EJD!!!
__label__2 Tom Cruise at his Best: I'm not normally a big Tom Cruise fan. This movie was on cable a while ago, and I caught part of it. It was so good, that I immediately ordered it on Amazon.Tom Cruise makes a great cold-blooded killer who is arrogant and charming, yet occasionally very human. Jamie Foxx is excellent as his unwilling partner, a cabbie with unfulfilled dreams of Success. The L.A. scenery is used very well as the backdrop for the Criminal activity. There is a wonderfully choreographed nightclub scene that is a sort of ballet of Violence. The end comes almost too soon, always a sign that it's a good movie. One of the Best crime dramas of this millenium, so far !
__label__1 Don't waste your money.: Don't waste your money on this book. It primarily consists of muddy images of pages from other books which are available in many large genealogy libraries. The lists of addresses, maps, and bibliographic citations can easily be found on the internet or in other books on Irish genealogy. You'd be better off buying yourself a Michelin map of Ireland, and checking out the county on the WorldGenWeb.
__label__1 Cable didn't work.: Order a different brand and save yourself the trouble of sending them back. I was very disappointed I wasted my time.
__label__1 waste of time: This stand wouldn't even hold itself up, much less two bikes. We live in an apt were I'm not able to secure to the wall. Don't waste your time or money on this. Amazon does stand behind what they sell, which is the only bright thing about this transaction.
__label__1 sad sad day: it's a sad day when something so serious is thrown into a comedy. If you must read this book, "to keep and open mind" might i suggest also reading "A Case for Christ" followed by "A Case for Faith" Then decide exactly how funny the subject matter is.
__label__1 YUCK! Painful.: My mother told me it was a terrible book. I read it, and I agree 100 percent. Firstly, it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with GWTW. Secondly, Rhett WOULD NOT marry another woman. Sure, he'd leave Scarlett, but only to make her sorry for whatever she did. Thirdly, every child should know her siblings. But Scarlett isolated Cat from that opportunity. The week in which I read it was painful. It could not have been more painful if someone had taken a red hot poker an applied it to my backside. Moreover, If you enjoy rewriting history and epic novels, by all means, go ahead.
__label__2 Point Taken!: I have to admit, that this movie was really "Straight in your face". There were so many scenes that I really felt. I thought that this movie was just going to be another hood movie but the reality of the plot really hit home. You don't have to be from the hood to feel this movie.
__label__1 It has some good points, but overall...: The life situations she uses don't match up to real life dilemma. Will look for something more realistic. Keep looking.
__label__1 Way to many errors: This book has an excellent choice of topics, use of figures, and numerous well presented examples. It would be an excellent book, except it has so many errors it is almost useless. I am working though the early chapters and examples as a refresher, since I am familiar already with this material, and have found errors in almost every section. Often the errors are subtle, an exponent missing here or an incorrect integration bound there, including in key equations, making them very difficult to find if you don't already know the material and are willing to work through it in detail. I have completely lost confidence in the book. When I go to later chapters, which are new material to me, I never know if my misunderstanding is the result of my missing something or Ludeman's unbelievably sloppy production. Hopefully he will come out with a second edition, and actually bother to proofread it.
__label__2 Would highly recommend this cookbook: Recipes are easy, simple ingredients and directions and best of all they are delicious ! Great encouragement for anyone who needs or wants to eat healthy.
__label__1 leica lenses: I expected a much more updated review of Leica lenses including the recent Summarit and Summilux lenses. I do not recommend this book for Leica fans.
__label__2 if HAL2001 and Racter teamed up to make an album: After hearing and bouncing to several songs in a local music store, I spontaneously bought this very fun CD. With robotic voices, thumpy beats and a heavy synthesizer, it's the sort of thing that any child of the eighties would love. And yet, it's not at all retro.Satisfaction, the first single off the album, has this Stephen Hawkings robotic voice singing a duet with a female robotic voice. That woman's voice is present on the rest of the album. I also like the introductory monologue that starts out "No Matter What You Do". Although many of the songs have a similar sound, they are all very catchy and have me tapping my feet to the beat.The album is aptly titled Hypnotica, and this album could equally serve as a background to work or for dancefloor anthems.
__label__2 angie is great: police women is a classic tv show ,i watched it when it frist out and was good, but even better know , recommend it to those who like classic tv!
__label__2 A great book, however...: Well, first of all, I must say, this book is one of the first books I ordered from Amazon.com. I finished it in one day. Ray Bradbury is one of the best writers of the century! I really loved the different points of view in the book (the native-martian, the first settlers, etc) and I thought the descriptions of views and the author's imagination are simply amazing. However, the thing I liked the most was also the one that bothered me,it was hard for me to get used to a different point of view every few pages... The problem is that there's no main character that exists through all the stories. Each time a new story begins I have to "re-adjust" myself for a new main character with new background and new everything... It was hard but after a while I got used to it and had a blast reading this awesome book.
__label__2 Good Job for XP: Great webcam just not for Vista users. Did me no good. Was able to return it and order the correct webcam for my system. Would recommend it to XP users.
__label__1 Wheelies and stoppies: Unleashed is ok. It is mainly a guy doing wheelies and stoppies throughout the whole 55 minutes of the dvd. There is some cool stuff in it. I am not saying the riders aren't talented, I'd just like to have seen more variety.
__label__2 An unexpected emotional ride: I discovered the Midnight Louie books over 2 years ago and have ravenosly read them all. Cat in a Neon Nightmare is full of unexpected surprises. A major chapter unexpectedly closes here and through Mrs. Nelson Douglas' artistry we are made to feel the void opened by this event as closely as those it affects in the book. Almost every character this time around is exposed to a truth or happenstance that disappoints them/shocks them at a deep soul biting level and we feel it right with them. Everything is not black and white, not all things happen due to premeditation--like real life--somethings just do. A wonderful continuation of the Midnight Louie adventures and by the emotions it evokes, a wonderful example of what a writer can make their readers feel when they have a grasp of the craft as well as Carole Nelson Douglas obviously does. Huzzah!
__label__1 Hmmmm....if LTJ is on it, I'm sure it's decent.: Well, that's perfect! None of your featured songs are even Less Than Jake songs! So why is it in the LTJ section?
__label__1 Leaks copiously: Much like other recent reviews, I had a problem with my Drinkwell leaking water everywhere. I was especially disappointed because I had the same model for about 5 years - I loved it and bought a replacement model.This company may have fallen prey to shrinking margins and Quality Assurance departments. As others have noted, the unit appears to leak continuously from the point where the motor is supposed to form a seal with the machine.The worst of it is, my cats are now scared of drinking, because of all the puddles they walked into. This device was supposed to alleviate the problem of my cats not drinking enough water, but they actually made it much worse.
__label__1 Requires Expensive Backing Plate: This may or may not be a good product from a usage standpoint, but Amazon and no one else apparently makes it clear that the product is useless without a velcro backing plate that costs another $20. They even try to sell it as an add on to a polisher without the backing plate!!If you want to use this pad with your polisher and it does not have a velcro backing plate, you will need to buy one.
__label__1 F61" Power issues 1 month after purchase: I had my unit for 1 month before experiencing the "F61" many people have seen. I calling their repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 months and it seems that none of the parts that Panasonic sent them could fix the unit. To this date, I still can't get Panasonic to send me a refurbished unit. On top of that, I had to drive the unit 97 miles to the nearest repair shop. I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it comes to servicing the warranty.
__label__2 Nice story of (seemingly) opposites attracted.: Good story of intelligent ladies, all writers, of various backgrounds and styles. They are assembled at a kind of retreat where they meet, get acquainted, discuss writing genres and styles. Some good, thoughtful discussions.The two main characters seem like water and oil at first, but come to appreciate each other, leading to a very nice relationship.
__label__2 The greatest book I have ever read: This book really did change my life and I try to apply the lessons learned on a daily basis. I wish this was required reading for the world.
__label__2 Excellent!!!: I decided to get back into poker (esp. NL hold'em) after dabbling with the game a couple of years ago. Wanting to gain useful knowledge, I decided on getting this book, due to the favorable reviews. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. This book has useful knowledge on literally every page. I am about 1/3 way through the book in 2 days and plan to re-read, along with taking notes, due to the large volume of useful content. As a side note, Dan Harrington is great to watch on TV tourney's - very solid player.
__label__1 My cat didn't like it: She wanted nothing to do with it And you can't just leave it for her to play with like I did because you will have ants everywhere like I did.
__label__2 Great!: Although most Oprah devotees would choose this book as their novel of choice just because Oprah chose it, it's still a great novel no matter what kind of book genre you are used to reading. My advice to you while reading this book, is to keep an open mind, and not read it for what everyone else is saying about it, but simply because YOU want to read it. Janet Fitch writes with a great, unique voice that sadly is often rare in this day and age. Some people may criticize Astrid in this book for some of the things she did, but like any other human, all she was doing was looking for love and a place where she could be herself, and feel safe. Although me and Astrid are the same age, I feel I learned a lot from her because she has lived things most of us have not seen or experienced yet in our lifetime. She is a real and honest character, and if you want to learn more about another side of life and love, than you should definitely read this book.
__label__2 An excellent resource: This book gives you the resources to start your online bookselling with a bang! Many things are reviewed, including important websites and tactics. It could have had a better tax review, however. But probably the best book to start out with!
__label__1 Wrong Cable!: Like several others, I received the wrong cable from Westronics. Black and "Indoor Only". Amazon gave me a full refund - I would strongly suggest not buying this item.
__label__2 The straight facts: Author Richard Purdue has succeeded at what many others haveattempted and failed: making sense out of the publishingindustry: mainstream, print-on-demand, the vanity press andE-books. His knowledge and insights are indispensable toevery writer, and "The Self-Publishing Delusion" should berequired reading for established pros as well as anyone whoaspires to see his or hear name adorning a book. And the section in which Purdue, himself and editor and publisher, correspondswith writers is priceless.
__label__2 The game: This book was great. I normally hate to read a book with that many pages but when i started reading this book I could not put it down.
__label__2 Economical way to get the job done: I bought this tow bar to haul a 1995 Jeep Wrangler behind our motor home.The price/quality equation is about right. The bar performs well and does what it's supposed to do, but it lacks the features of high-end bars made by other manufacturers (e.g. storage on the motor home, only having to get the tow vehicle 'close' to the bar to complete hookup, etc.). Additionally, the kit doesn't include safety chains (although the bar has mounts for them). A trip to the local Wal-Mart solves that issue.Given this towing solution costs hundreds of dollars less than a higher-end one, I'll put up with the minor inconveniences encountered while hooking up/unhooking. Overall an economical way to tow flat-bumpered cars.
__label__2 nice sleeping bag!: We received the sleeping bags fast and on time. We camped with them and the kids love them. My kids are 2 and 3 and did not have a problem with using the sleeping bags. My two year old was unable to unzip the bags fine and they did not get stuck. We camped in rainy and colder conditions, but they stayed warm and toasty in the bags. The color is nice for boys and girls, especially since they are darker and do not get dirty as soon as a light colored ones. I have washed one of them on the camping trip and it held up really nice. Both of them were washed when we came home and they held up nicely. They are warm enough for cold weather and easily cared for. They fit in the stuff sack when neatly rolled up, as you would with any sleeping bag.
__label__1 Falling Star: This was the worst book I have ever read. Not only was there no plot or climax, it was very silly and pointless. Spinelli tried to make this book very moving and inspirational...hmm...maybe that's why it's not an American classic? I have been more inspired by paintings in museums.The main character, Stargirl, was not believable at all. She was very immature for a high schooler and reminded me of a three-year old. Everything she did was random, also. She had her own special place in the Arizona Desert, which was supposed to be meaningful in the story, but it didn't make much sense. She also tried to go do nice things for people, which is sweet, but hard to believe. A friend of mine, who disliked the book also, put it simply: "The whole teenage-insecurities thing." I had to read this book for school, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that doesn't have to read it.
__label__1 The kids are all right, but this movie's not!: Very disappointing movie. Actually, the movie really sucked. Did anyone in production/creation of this movie ever meet a lesbian couple???? Apparently not... First, what's up with the flower-child dialogue? No one really talks like that; in California or anywhere else. Right on?? I guess someone was trying to follow a stereotype of granola, crunchy, non-confrontational lesbians...? I didn't see any Birkenstocks though... hmmm... the rest of the dialogue was meaningless fluff... it was impossible to care about any of the characters since they were so poorly created. And since when do lesbians watch gay male porn?? Are you kidding me??? And of course, one of them HAS to have sex with a man...Don't waste your time.
__label__1 Amazing Album, Crappy Vinyl: This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Unfortunately, Sides B and D are completely unlistenable due to all the skips and pops. Amazon should not be selling this faulty product.
__label__2 badarse: JSR is the real fake here, not Woodie. JSR is only knockin' Woodie cause he will never have the talent that Woodie has. So buy this cd and if you ever see JSR slap him like the female dog that he is.
__label__1 What happened to country music: If I wanted a cheesy boy band pop cd I should have bought the backstreet boys. What happened to country music??? Artists like faith hill, Shania Twain, Tim Mcgraw and Rascal Flatts to name a fewe are selling out and leaving their roots. I guess George Strait and Alan Jackson were right, murder has been committed on music row. If you are a fan of real country music don't but this cd.
__label__1 Life is too short....don't waste it on this book!: I read about 1/3 of the way through and I just couldn't do it anymore. I skipped the rest of the way through to the end. The premise is good but this book would have to be severly abridged to be enjoyable.
__label__2 Puts other 'portable' scanners to shame: I've seen several other companies try to produce portable printers or scanners and they have all fallen short of the Canon BJC-55/85. One main reason is this little device that allows you to carry both at once! The software is extremely easy to use. In part because there are no settings to change; you can only ever scan at 300 dpi (most flatbeds have much higher resolution, thus my rating of 4 stars).However, the image is crisp, color is good, and the unit snaps in very easily. I only wish they included a hard case like the one for the ink cartridge which came with the printer instead of a flimsy plastic "storage" bag. It is so tiny, this is probably the only scanner you'll ever worry about losing :)
__label__2 Great Machine: Its really a great machine with all great features of "Vaio". i haven't felt any problem in it and now i cant wotk on any other notebook:)
__label__2 Revelation: I am using "Revelation" by C.M. Kemmpton for a Bible study class. The class has folks from a wide variety of theological views. Kempton's study guide works for us all. The application questions are thought provoking and the questions titled, "What does it say" help the class get more out of the text. Great book at a very reasonable price. Rev. Jack Williams
__label__2 Even better than the last!: I must be one of the lucky few in the UK to have read these wonderful stories as they aren't yet published over here. What has impressed me has not only been the quality of storytelling, but the whole "package" - the bindings, covers, front pages all show what care has been put into the series. I'm not sure that the British versions (out in the autumn) are so good. Anyway, as for "The Vile Village", this has to be the strongest episode yet, even better than "The Ersatz Elevator"! The story stands well on its own with enough clues to want you to shout out to help the siblings (where are the Quagmires? who is Officer Luciana?) and hints of the continuing plotlines are teasingly dangled in front of you - just how is Lemony Snicket involved in the whole saga? I cannot wait to visit "The Hostile Hospital"!
__label__1 Was Dr. Phil seriously the Author of this book?: This book was very disappointing. I was about 2/3 of the way through and I finally had to quit. I've been impressed with his other books and am so surprised that he really authored this book. In my opinion it was depressing and definitely should not be in the category of "self-help," unless you're trying to help yourself get really down and out.
__label__1 A Crashing Disappointment: For many people trying to lose a few pounds, this book appears to be the ultimate solution - what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! The health/nutritional information offers nothing new, the questionaire is ridiculous and the diet suggestions require you to remember vast amounts of information as to what you can and can't eat. If you can afford to give up your day job in order to apply yourself to this diet, or of you have a chef in residence at your home, then go for it. But, if the questionaire indicates you are a mixed burner - then use the book as a door stop as it has no other use. For a no-nonsense approach to food choices, I strongly recommend Picture Perfect Weight Loss by Dr. Shapiro.
__label__2 Great songs and fun product: This is a fun product and highlights some basics in Hebrew and Jewish traditions. I often turn the DVD on in the background without the video so we can listen to the songs while playing.
__label__1 Cover art good and nothing else.: I read the reviews so I expected garbage and that's what I got. Hollywood Video was closing and I got it cheap, but even a couple dollars is too much. Don't let the cover art fool you-REALLY! The movie really is as crappy as everyone else says. No plot point was resolved satisfactorily. Why they tried to bring vampires into this, well, in capable hands that might have actually been interesting to mix the genres... but NOT here. We've got zombies, vampires, and the antichrist (who's a young black boy) in this movie, everything except entertainment. In some low budget films there might even be some redeeming nudity, but again, NOT here. I don't mind low budget, but this was just awful.
__label__2 cool: This stuff works! My computer was freezing up because, ironically, it was running hot at the cpu. After applying the product, it dropped my cpu temp. 10-15 degrees C. Now it doesn't freeze up anymore.
__label__1 LOUSEY!!! Truly awful.: This thing is totally useless. You could roll it over a lime leaf or basil for 10 minutes and not even make one slice. It really does merely "bruise" your herbs! I find it very hard to believe that OXO tried using this in a test kitchen before marketing it. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!
__label__1 NOT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED: The description of this camera states that it is panoramic. It is not, so needless to say I was quite disappointed.
__label__2 The best Leapster Game!: This game as been a favorite of all my children and is currently my four year old daughter's favorite game. There is so much to do with this game. You can make pictures, do mazes, write your letters and numbers, connect the dots, and that is just what I remember off the top of my head. It is a great way to bring coloring with you when you otherwise can't bring the crayons and paint. It is a great introduction or reinforcer for writing your letters and numbers. The mazes teach fine motor control - you have to stay in the lines or start over (which can be a bit frustrating). And the mazes go from really big to really small spaces. This game has had more play time than any other in my house and has stoped more temper tantrums while we were shopping or driving than any other.
__label__1 GRRRRRRRRRR: It's the only radiator I could find and it has PLASTIC top and bottom, which I KNOW will crack in about two to three years! I HATE THIS PURCHASE BUT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE! If you can find an all aluminium radiator pay what ever extra and do it, you will save a lot more money long term. Unless your screwing people over in resell or trade in, then that's up to you. For me even I would invest in the well being of others! HATE THIS PLASTIC!Product fit, no problem with installing, looking at trashing my car, simply because I won't be able to depend on this part. PLASTIC %^$%$&#
__label__1 Liked the idea of the book, just didn't like the book itself: I was intrigued by the cover description of the book and I generally like Gail Eastwood's book, but this one disappointed me. The historical aspects about the regency times, and about the hero's travels abroad were good, but I just didn't care enough about the plot and the characters. The hero had had previous lovers who had died in suspicious circumstances, and eventually the heroine is in danger as well. The whole plot was just too melodramatic for me to believe in it and get caught up in it. I should have felt sorry for the hero, losing his past loves, but it was hard for me to take the plot seriously. Gail Eastwood is an excellent writer--I just don't think this is one of her best books. Not one for my keeper shelf, although several of her other books have made it there.
__label__1 More of the same: These retirement books all make the same assumptions about the readers. When you assume you make an.....
__label__2 A Truly Great Book For All....: I first got this book for a book review and since it was really short, I thought, hey, can you do any better then 71 pages? But once I started the book, I found that I couldn't put it down. There is one particular page that describes the feelings of a lover and the beloved, all I can say is that it hit me hard because the author showed me what I was doing to a certain person in particular. But in the end, the book was about love, and how we all want to love someone even if their not willing to love us back. A great book, I recommend it to anyone. =)
__label__2 Great "Chamber Folk" CD: Wonderful CD. Mergers violins, clavinet and the wonderful voice of Sonya Cohen with interesting lyrics and enjoyable arrangments. Not for someone looking to 'rock out', but great for a quiet, thoughtful time.
__label__2 Fun and reusable: I've looked at different kinds of bead sets and tried a few, but this is the one that's actually considered a toy and not just a fashion accessory. Unlike other bead sets that create wearable necklaces but are rather frustrating to put together, this one is easy to thread even for little kids all by themselves and once they're done wearing it and playing with it, we dump the beads back in the box to play with again and again. There is a nice variety of colors (though not precisely what you see in the picture) and plenty of "pendants" and strings for multiple kids to play with at the same time.
__label__2 Great and easy to find what you need...: I am loving this book. Each time I find more information that is so helpful to me. I never thought creating my own tea blends to satisfy ME would be so easy and fun too. It is so easy to personalize my blends with this book.
__label__1 Waste of our time....: My daughter who is 8 and I never made it through the end of this movie. Let's just say we both hated it!!!!Don't waste your money or time! ... iab
__label__1 My order never arrived..I'm so upset..!!!: I emailed the company 3 times with no response and have filed a claim with Amazon against the company my CD was supposed to come from. I cannot believe it..!! my son's Christmas was ruined..!!!
__label__2 yummy single: great first single, hope to hear it on the radio. Lovely guitar and drums, good vocals, some weird background singers but otherwise a really good song.
__label__1 Hard to find a good bluetooth headset: Great product if you like the extras. But from a technical standpoint, the sound quality is below par. A lot of static.
__label__2 Nice Companion for a Dylan Fan: I have read a lot of scathing reviews about this album, and I'm here to set the record straight. Aside from a questionable list of songs, this album is a great example of Dylan at his throw-the-paint-on-the-canvas best. I might be in the minority when I suggest that Dylan's forgotten words and muffled voice exemplify his confidence rather than his shortcomings. I enjoy the "Slow Train" on this album better than its underdeveloped sister studio song because Dylan's inflection and rawness give it the muscle that it lacked. Let's not forget about Garcia either, whose solo brilliance (I Want You) shines at times. Yes, the songs are loose and Dylan and Garcia are unsure at times when a solo should begin ("Serve Somebody"), but if Dylan has taught us anything, it is that art mimics life. This album is a fine example of that.
__label__1 :(: didn't work for us... if it hadn't already been painfully installed into our home... I would have returned it for all that wasted money :(
__label__1 good price but capsules were stuck together: I bought these because I thought they were a good price. However, the capsules were stuck together and I finally had to cut open the container and pry them apart and put them into another container. Too much hassle to risk ordering again.
__label__1 Terrible Waste of Money!: I bought this book because of the rave reviews it received here, so I am writing this to let others know they should not be deceived as I was. If this book cost $10 I MIGHT say it was worth the money, but essentially it was 170 pages of large print and screen shots, all illustrating examples of one strategy (not 10), which can be boiled down to:1) Trade with the trend.2) Enter following a pullback after resumption of the trend.
__label__1 Fried Our Chi Iron !!!: This converter did not work. We used it in the UK with my daughter's expensive Chi hair straightener. There was instantly a buzzing noise and the ceramic plates started to melt giving off a burning plastic smell. The iron was ruined! If you value your appliance, take my advice and leave it at home rather than risking it with this horrible product.
__label__2 The Pages with Craving/Needs is worth the price of the book: What got me to buy this book was a teacher who used it - in the back it has a list of craving foods and what it represents as far as emotional needs unmet. That list is worth the price of the book.
__label__1 I still hate this book: I had to rate this a second time because my one star rating only reduced the overall rating (it's been reviewed by one other reader) to a two and a half and that's two and a half too many.I feel like a chump for buying it, but I'm happy admitting my mistake to the world if it could save one helpless soul from having to read paragraphs like...:"The book as a whole, then, is not treelike in structure. It is not an arborescence. Instead it takes the form of a rhizomatic network. It makes overlaps and juxtapositions, and it makes interference effects as a result of making these overlaps. So that is the fourth way of introducing the book. It is about writing fractionally." - p. 9 John Law, Aircraft Stories.You really don't want to know about other three ways of introducing the book. I was struggling during the first two, the third had me gasping for air and number four was kinda it for me.
__label__2 Outstanding!: In my opinion, as a writer/artist myself, this is one of the best Star Wars art books for all who love traditional illustration. Whether you're a graphic novel artist or just a Star wars fan, I highly recommend this book for your collection. The artwork and the majestic visualization skill is simply breathtaking. It also includes sketches, studies, roughs... besides the great writing around it, which explaining everything else. I give it 5 out 5 stars because it is priceless!
__label__1 Takes a while to get cold again after use.: The first one of these I bought was defective - I would never shut off the cooling cycle and the "cold" light would never come on. Returned (they would not issue a refund), so I had to get another one. It works OK, but can take up to 3 hours to get to the "cold" setting and stop the cooling cycle. Somewhat noisy when cooling. I might recommend looking for another unit before buying this one.
__label__2 Witty and wonderful!: This book reminded me of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. It is so wellwritten. It is full of wit and heartwarming understanding of the workingsof young boys. I enjoyed it as much as any book I have read all year andwould highly recommend it to any age group.
__label__2 A great place to start!: This is a great place to start. For someone who was used to being in great shape and then let children interfere with keeping myself in shape, this tape has brought me back off the couch. It could use more strength training, but everyone should know that one workout cannot possibly do everything you need. It is the first tape I have ever seen that has convinced me to do it everyday. As my fitness gets back to where it should be, the advanced workout will be a supplement. For those of you who complain about still being fat after a week of hard work, think about how long it took you to get fat! Get to work!
__label__1 Not able to install: The manufacturer evidently doesn't offer support for this product, and the company that they referred us to is hard to reach / get help from.
__label__1 piece of crap: OK I bought this because of all of the high reviews expaecting more channels and better signal, well, I got neither. I got the same channels and worse quality than before. I tried moving it and I lost one of the two I already had and if people say that maybe there are just two in the area, I researched it there are at least four maybe five. Do not buy the glorified piece of junk!
__label__2 Great art work: When I finished reading this book, I had to stop and think about what I just read. Not because the book was confusing, but because there was hardly any talking. From the dialoge that was said you or at least I got that feeling that something important is about to happen. The book just cuts off in the end with out explaining what just took place the precending pages. If you want to find out what happen I would suggest you pick up volumes 1 and 2 at the same time, but since 2 has not come out as of today 8-2-04) you might have to wait awhile. The art work is great. And yes you well be looking a a half naked female most the time.
__label__1 No support from Nisus: Nisus has nice software, but they will not support you. Avoid this stuff !! I wrote them about 10 times after my Nisus crashed, and they just blow you off with short e-mails. Terrible support. Avoid at all costs !!
__label__1 Don't buy Half-Life!: I would not buy PS2 HL because HL is set up for the PC. It would not be the same and it only costs (some bucks) for the PC version or you can the Platinum Pack for (twice as much) which also has HL:OpFor, TFC and C-Strike. I have never played HL for PS2, but im sure that it could never beat the PC version. The original PC version is the best game out there.
__label__2 Mile High Fantastic!: This album is loaded with truly wonderful lyrics. Add to that a variety of catchy rock/pop rhythms and superb instrumentation and you get an absolute winner! Be aware: you may become a total Parthenon Huxley fan.
__label__2 Excellent: Excellent, I am very satisfied with this order. Couldn't find a better deal at a better price and have this excellent product.
__label__1 Complete rip off--not worth the money: I paid $50 for this and I'm kicking myself for it. It does "spray" soap and water onto the cars, but just barely. Even if you put a towel under it, it still manages to make an absolute mess. The parts that are supposed to move barely move, and those that aren't supposed to, do. My 3 yr old was bored with it after a few minutes. Don't waste your money on this one!
__label__1 Forgettable...not like her at all.: I am a huge Tori Amos fan, and have been for the past twelve years. This record is the biggest disappointment in her catalogue. None of the songs sound terrible when listening to them, but a couple of days later, I cannot, for the life of me, recall what the hell they sound like. I rank "The Beekeeper" even lower than "Strange Little Girls" because, while at least half of that album was spectacularly awful, none of it was forgettable. This record is just bland. Dull. It sounds, to my ear, like an uninspired retread of the same ground covered on its predecessor, the stellar "Scarlet's Walk." I have always considered Tori the ultimate "love-her-or-hate-her" artist, and I never would have dreamed that she was even capable of making such a "take-it-or-leave-it" album.
__label__1 If you own a MAC RUN!: It took me forever to get this scanner working with Mac OSx Leopard.After I upgraded to Snow Leopard it broke again.The support for MACs is abysmal and as others pointed out the photo feeder jams constantly or will miss grabbing the photo forcing you to feed them in one at a time as well as correcting for miss alignment.Horrible absolutely Horrible.
__label__2 Wonderful book!: I have really enjoyed this book. The shipping was reasonable and I got it petty quickly. I can't wait for the next book!
__label__2 Picks up where Mr. Watson left off, and goes way beyond: Matthieson has one of the most unique and evocative writing styles, and for a person who grew up in NYC, his ability to write in the voices of denizens of the everglades is amazing. It gets a little slow at certain points, as some of the same ground is gone over many times - but once you finish, you realize that this repetitiveness is exactly what the main character's obsession with his father's death would lead too: he just can't let go; he needs to keep at it, no matter the cost. And what a cost. Overall, I loved it. I can't wait for the last installment of the triology.
__label__1 Not Up to Grisham Standard: Very disappointing effort from a normally great writer. Clearly Mr. Grisham is under contract with his publisher to spit out a novel every year or so. This pales in comparison to his past efforts. There's no depth to the characters and the story is boring. The ending is not even an ending; he simply stopped writing and submitted his manuscript. But, he ... me in with his name recognition alone. So, I guess it worked from a bottom line point of view. Don't waste your time with this one. Read "The Firm" again, instead. That was vintage Grisham.
__label__1 I cannot see one redeeming quality of this book!: It is not only poorly written, even confusing at times, but it lacks imagination and credibiliy.Yes,I KNOW it's supposed to be a fantasy, but it doesn't take the reader far enough to make that leap, and therefore falls through all the cracks. It also portrays the "eccentric neighbor" annoyingly, as we all know who it is supposed to be, and there is nothing credible there, either. I agree with "Skeptic 505" that if it were possible, I would rate this book with Zero stars...and don't waste your money.
__label__2 Exelent picture: The tv has better image than a sony bravia and more futures also is a verry good buy for a good price .
__label__2 These Texas Rangers Rock: I loved this show when I was growing up and I still love it. Excellent cast work so well together with witty comedic writing in a western setting. It's delightful fun.
__label__2 Kaipa's best so far.: While I think The Tangent was mortally wounded by the deparature of Stolt, I did not notice him missing here. Granted he is a guitar god in all his endeavors but give the rest of Kaipa the credit they deserve.I think Angling Feelings actually stronger than Mindrevolutions and Keyholder. I also think the Inside Out Label brings out the best in all their acts.Perfectly balanced melodic keyboards and guitar with great lyrics and singing too. ProgRock at its best.
__label__2 TV wall mount: The TV wall mount is designed very well and ample hardware is provided.I feel the unit could be lighter by the use of some aluminum and still be strong enough. overall I would rate it as a quality product.
__label__2 It was good service and good speed shipping. Item was as described and works like a charm.: These blades/screens last about a year or less for me. I like them and have no complaints other than I wish they would last longer.
__label__1 Not worth it: Item doesn't work at all. It might be my apartment, but save your money anyways. It is not worth wasting 12 dollars.
__label__2 I love John!: John is amazing. I too fell in love with him well before he became mainstream. The man is so talented. I give him props for writing his own music and actually playing his instrument. I have had the chance to see him in concert twice and it was without a doubt some of the best shows that I have ever attended. His songs are very heartfelt, and it is easy to see where he is coming from. He does not sound like a carbon copy of anyone. You will hear his influnences in his music, but that is because they are just that, an influence. If you have respect for the true singer songwriter then this is the album for you.
__label__2 Even better graphics! But new additions to learning...eh..: I loved the new great even more realistic graphics! But I did hate the quizzes that you have to do in the temple of the museum. I liked how you travelled and you did learn quite a bit about the Mayan culture because of the quizzes, but it was frustrating having to go back and forth around the museum to find answers. Pretty freaky too! As usual of course. It was a good story and plot and the game was of course fun like always! They also give a laptop for you to use so you can keep track of notes easier and you don't have to waste a bunch of paper! But I hate how you have to scroll ALL the way down just to look at the lastest notes you have! Despite all the bad parts, which is very little, it was still a good game and very enjoyable! :)
__label__1 Don't help my wife, waste of money: I would like to post good comments about this products, but since i receive the box my problems started, the product seems to be refurbished, then when my wife tried to use she felt her belly stretching, a strange and bad sensation! She also complained about the size of hole in the air bed, too big! She is pregnant of 36 weeks, and now, neither for guest we can use the air bed, because the cushion that goes inside of hole, which was supposed to be inflated, don't keep more than 10 second, so we just bought an air bed with a hole inside!!!!
__label__1 Clunky clamps: These clamps are kinda flimsy-probably why they are cheap. Table edge must be exact size of the clamp or it doesn't work well. What are the odds of all tables being the same size?
__label__1 Not worth it: I am a guy who loves horror movies, the more scary or disturbing the better. I thought this looked pretty good and scary but it really was not ... more of a thriller than a horror.
__label__1 poor quality compared to my other flameless candles: I added this set to my 4 other flameless candles. Compared to my other (much more expensive) candles, these are pretty poor quality. 2 of the 6 don't work at all, and the flame is not nearly as realistic looking. To me, these candles look closer to Christmas twinkle lights than my other flameless candles.I bought these because they are rechargeable which is very convenient; However, my other candles have run every night for months on the same 2 AA batteries.I'll be replacing these with the more expensive brand I purchased before. The lower quality is not worth the money I saved.
__label__2 Pricing: I love my Kindle 2nd generation. I can't imagine being without it. Having said that, I must tell you that when I purchased my first Kindle it was weeks before the first price reduction. I have had my new Kindle a few short weeks and now there has been another huge price reduction. I called and asked for a credit and was told no. Too bad, but there would be no credits by Amazon for recent purchases prior to the price reduction.With more competition coming from other sources this policy by Amazon will cause me to look long and hard at other products the next time I purchase a new device.Sincerely,Richard Greenlawpspdick@dc.rr.com
__label__1 Improved, but still lackluster: The Tiger Woods franchise has improved a bit from its dismal earlier days, but when you play this game, you ask yourself...where's the fun? Answer: If you don't care much about golf celebs, not much.This game is unrealistically easy. BAD golf physics. In almost no time I was shooting a 49...without really trying. How much fun is that? I guess if you're easily amused...Also, the game seems to lack the flair and fun factor of the Hot Shots series, or even new-kid-on-the-block Outlaw Golf. If you want to be stuffy and pretentious like real golfers, this is your game...if you want to have fun (and, ironically, a more realistic golf physics engine), go with Hot Shots 3.
__label__2 Nursery rhymes rock with the times: This is a wonderful way for kids to learn nursery rhymes. And they love the rock n'roll/hard rock music, they listen to sing along. Cute idea.
__label__2 A wonderful story: This a wonderful story that works on so many levels. It has a well delivered message and it is beautifully woven around an involving plot. It is also a history lesson. The intersection of setting and time are fascinating, particularly to anyone who has vacationed on the beautiful beaches of Gulf Shores and Orange Beach. It's hard to imagine what life was like during World War II in what is now a popular vacation destination, but this book will take you there and have you wishing you could travel back to that time and meet these characters.But, above all, this is a wonderful story.Enjoy!
__label__2 Useful: This doesn't seem like that great a product at first. I mean, wireless, who needs it, right?Until you dig that cord out of your closet and find the thing in knots that you have to untangle. Or you're connected to your buddy with the cord, and one of you needs to leave real quick, and you/he/she trip over the cord....Personal experiences aside, this is a decent product. Doesn't work for every game, but it simplifies life in general.
__label__2 The New Brewer's Bible: i have been homebrewing since high school and this is the best brew book ever for all levels of brewers; equipment, basic extract brewing to all grain brewing; it is the new brewer's bible. Thank you John Palmer!
__label__1 Oh....Prunella....: This Is The Kinda Flick That Will Turn Your Date Into A Lesbian..!.....Forever A Man Hater..!.......Oh..Well....
__label__1 Tired formula writing: There really is no point in straying beyond O'Brian, Forrester, Parkinson or Showell Styles. Kent and Pope are in the same mould; poor research, improbable characters, formula writing. Don't waste your time on this book.
__label__1 Uneven and sometimes inaccurate: This book is very thorough on certain subjects, too much so in fact. It repeatedly gives instructions for procedures that anyone studying Enterprise should already KNOW (such as creating an NT boot disk and creating user accounts). Other areas are incomplete, including subjects touched on in the testing software.The last third of the book was not very well edited, and there are numerous typos.The testing software on the CD did not record all of my answers properly, at least one "correct" answer was wrong, and several questions referenced pages in the book that did not give information pertaining to the correct answer.This book might be a good introduction for NT Server in general, but do not rely on this alone for the Enterprise exam! (And don't buy a book on the strength of ONE review)
__label__1 Mixup in DVD's. Wrong moving being sent out by sellers.: I have ordered this video (Sierra Fly Fishing, Vol. 2) twice now from different sellers. Both times I was sent "Oh, Mr. Fawlkner, Do You Write?" There must be some sort of UPC error or something that is causing this mixup.
__label__1 remote is useless: remote is useless it gives false readings and is very hard to read if I had known more about this product I would not have bought it.
__label__1 A long Stewart Title brochure: This book has good information about real estate ownership and purchase in Mexico, but it is repetitive and constantly touts Stewart Title. I felt like the book should have been edited to a fifth the size and given free.
__label__1 Falls short of other Amusement Park games...: I was a big fan of the original "Theme Park" game, so I grabbed this one as soon as I got a PS2. It's not bad, but definitely falls short of other Amusement Park building sims, such as Rolle Coaster Tycoon and the original Theme Park.My biggest complaint is the restrictions in themes. Each location has its own theme. You don't get to choose the theme. You can't mix themes. I think it would be a lot more fun if you could just choose from a pool of rides and buildings like in others.The interface can also be a little awkward at times. About the only really fun part is the 3d walkthrough of the park, and riding the coasters you design. But that feature is available on far better amusement park simulation games.
__label__1 hate it: No Counting allowed with poor picture and quality. do not waste your money on this item or on any of there other videos.
__label__1 Hype and publicity do not a musician make: Although Watson's aim of bringing opera to the masses is a worthy cause,the fact remains that 'the Voice' is disappointing. Watson has never had formal training and it shows. His voice is often reedy, lacking the smooth velvet of the likes of Safina, Bocelli and even Groban. Some sustained notes feel strained and jumps from low to high often feel choppy and lack smoothness. A good collection of songs but somewhat poorly sung. The work of a karaoke amatuer, one would do better with the wonderful Alessandro Safina.
__label__2 Yeahhhhh, finally released on DVD: I have been waiting so long for this brilliant show to be released. It is just so much fun, I love everything about this show. I did buy a 'Dodgy Set' about two years ago, cost a fortune and the quality was to say the least, extremly poor, but I watched it anyway, that's how much I love this show, so roll on June....Just waiting for 'Hawaiian Eye' and 'Surfside Six' to be released, it's the simple things in life that put a smile on your face.
__label__2 Is It Just Me? I can't get the sticks to stay in!: First off - the idea of these is great. They are sturdy, compact, and a neat design that the boys love.When I make popsicles out of juice or fruit, all is well. They do drip outside the holder at the bottom, even for the neatest eaters, so outside is the trick. But that's just fine.My only challenge so far has been making ice cream pops. We make our own ice cream and I want to freeze it into popsicles. But I have not been able to get the ice cream to come out of the mold on the stick, no matter how long I leave it in the freezer. Any suggestions?(*)>
__label__1 Perfect at first - DOESN'T LAST: I was happy with this item and used it frequently (once a week) for about 6 months. The silver parts were discolored after first run through the microwave, but continued to work. In the sixth month of use, the top would pop off after 4 minutes of microwaving. I would put the top back on and restart the cooking. Finally today it popped off twice in 4 minutes. The third time it popped off and then the eggs exploded all over the microwave. It has become unusable.Also note: Very hot! The top, the bottom, and the eggs cannot be handled for at least 10 minutes after hard-boiling.
__label__2 A darkly beautiful book: I have nothing to add that hasn't been said, but when it comes to a book like this, I feel I have to respond.. This book is disturbing, haunting, and strangly beauttiful. It also was one of the first fantasy books that didn't try to simplfy the issue of good and evil. A book that makes you love the "Enemy" even when you know he has to be killed, is a work of ginius.The book raised the question of identity, freedom, love, revenge and their affect upon society. I won't pretent that I understood all the issues raised. But at least I felt they were there, and dealt with in their complex, vibrant form
__label__2 I am a fan of the Seeker: The DVD came in just as promised and the product was excellent.I am a fan of the Seeker and love to read the books as well asthe movies.
__label__1 Blender: Waste of money. It broke after about six months then we couldn't get a replacement part for it. I wouldn't buy this product again. Customer service was even worse.
__label__2 Hello, this is for a road bike!: True enough; when I pulled this bag out of the shipping box I was reminded of that old '60s show 'Land of the Giants'. I was a you know what compared to this bag. I knew it would be smaller. Road bikes don't have a lot of extra seat-post sticking in the seat tube. Since this bag was intended to be clamped & cantilevered to the seat-post via their racks Topeak never intended this bag to be able to haul a gallon of milk for instance. Road bikes were never designed for a rack system...not a bona fide road bike anyway. This bag will hold a jacket and/or some dinner for that night...not necessarily at the same time.28 x 15 x 18~23 cm11.0" x 5.9" x 7.1"~9.1"That's from the Topeak WebsiteCapacity 11.47 l / 700 ciSo's that. Better than nothing at all in variable weather while still enjoying your roadster.
__label__2 A MUST READ!: Spellbinding and fascinating book; I couldn't put it down. It is terrifying too, that the role of Pakistan (or the ISI) has been totally missed by everyone but BHL. I also love the way he writes; different from other writers in his questioning style. Also it evokes many more questions and makes you want to investigate yourself. Very scrupulous in his investigation and his intelligence..I highly recommend this book.
__label__2 Wonderful! The best children's video on the market!: My 10 month old son started watching Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein when he was 8 weeks old. He can't go one day without watching Baby Mozart and he is also quite fond of Baby Einstein. If he is in a fussy mood we can put in the Baby Mozart video and he immediately cheers up when he sees the Bear at the beginning of the video. It is amazing! My husband and I were hesitant about allowing him to watch TV at such a young age, but it is amazing how much focus and concentration he has developed. We believe this to be, in part, because of Baby Mozart. I highly recommend this video to everyone. I have personally purchased it for all of my friends and family!
__label__2 Dont Sleep: This album is a collection of dope beats and dope emcees on the uprise, please be clear when I say emcees, with ill lyrical content that will not disappoint any hip hop head.It is definitely worth listening too, and worth owning.
__label__1 S****: Don't waste your time or money! This is a s***** movie. Would have given it zero stars if possible, or negative one.
__label__1 Poor Service: Ordered the SanDisk 256 MB card for my NIKON Coolpix 5000. Card worked fine for 6 mos and then stopped working right after Christmas. I called for a warranty replacement (it's guarenteed for 5 yrs or so they say per written warranty)and then the runaround began. They close for the Christmas Holidays for 10 days. NO ONE is available to issue an RMA for a replacement? Finally after numerous calls I got an RMA# and sent the faulty card back per their instructions. Now I can't find out anything about the replacement card as they just don't seem to be able to get back to me with the status of the replacement card. Over a month and no replacement card. Stuck using the camera included card of 32 MB capacity. I would not reccommend this company to anyone. Customer support is terrible. Their promises to contact me about warranty issues is very poor. Caveat emptor. I will now go to Viking. SanDisk just doesn't seem to care.
__label__2 School Book Review: Have you ever seen a baby who gets Super Powers? I read a book about a baby who got super powers. The author was Dav Pilkey and the book is called Super Diaper Baby. It's funny and I'm sure you will love it as much as I did. So if you really like it you could read it about 4-6 times. So I went to Borders and bought that book. What are you waiting for go? Go and get Super Diaper Baby. It's a comic book. Have fun reading it. I wish you the best of luck . My favorite part was when Super Diaper Baby destroyed the Robo Ant 2000 and Deputy Doo Doo got really mad at Super Diaper Baby. It's going to make you read it over and over again. So don't miss Super Diaper Baby coming to a store near you.
__label__2 Read remind me of The Help: I really enjoyed this one. I couldnt put it down to find out how the summer ended. Sissy dont take no mess from NO ONE.... way to live your life by YOUR rules !!
__label__2 Must see: Everyone in the US should watch this, just to show you what is happening around the world and it's at our doorstep.
__label__2 Great mask: I wore this with a catwoman outfit b/c the ears on that one did not stay up. This mask however was pretty cool, shiny, fit ok and kept me warm when I was cold LOL. It does have a ride up factor but with time spent repositioning I finally got it so that it would not ride up. I had lots of great compliments on this and recommend to others.
__label__2 Dewalt 18 volt nicad power is super!!!: I am really amazed at the power and the lenght of operation of the dewalt 18v nicad system. I have many of the dewalt tools that work with these batteries, having cordless saws, drills, impact drivers is very convenient.
__label__1 BARBRA STREISAND: THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE WORST STREISAND ALBUMS EVER, THE FIRST BEING "HIGHER GROUND". BARRY GIBB IS TRYING TO SING AS HE DID AS A YOUNG MAN...HIGH PITCHED VOICE, IT MAY HAVE WORKED IN THE 70'S....BUT NOT TODAY. AS FAR AS BARBRA....STICK TO WHAT YOU DO BEST....GO BACK TO BROADWAY.
__label__2 Spectacular adventure!: THIS is why we go to the movies! Whether fact or fiction, this is anamazing story and an expertly made motion picture. It's a many layeredtale, with rich characterizations, telling of multiple culturesinvolved in a fabled race. Superb cinematography throughout, withawesome scenery, sumptuous costumes, magnificent horses, gorgeousactors, etc, etc... It held my interest from beginning to end. It's nota traditional western in the sense that it does not take place only inthe American west. Yet, it is a western in character. The addeddimension of the Arabian desert makes for an even more spectacular andadventurous story.While it may be too intense for very young children, I'd still say it's good for all ages, a spectacular adventure.I highly recommend it, especially if you have a wide-screen TV.
__label__1 Ripped open in less than 5 minutes: My 15 lb dog ripped this toy open between the eyes almost as soon as we gave it to him. What a waste of money. I wouldn't buy any toys from Jakks Pacific ever again. We've had much better luck with the Dr. Noys and Plush Puppies toys.
__label__1 JVC Video Tapes: My product arrived a little less timely than expected for my upcoming shoot, however, it appeared to be in great condition and exactly what I ordered. You can't beat the price per tape, for those of us still using tapes. My only advice is order well in advance of need. IT takes approximatley two weeks or more to arrive.
__label__2 awesome: its better then Wal-Mart's stuff my pup doesn't mind it as much ass the cheaper stuff oh and it work just not how you might think it does. get your pups teeth cleaned and use this every other day or every day your pups teeth will stay white and helthy my pups teeth have been white for 3 months now and this shtuff work . gettem
__label__2 WONDERFUL, CLASSY, EXCEPTIONAL, STUNNING!!!!: THIS VIDEO JUST TAKES MY BREATH AWAY I LOVE THIS VIDEO I WAS LUCKY TO GET IT ON DVD FOR A VERY LOW PRICE. THIS IS A TRULY MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES BROADWAY MUSICALS I LOVE THIS VIDEO THE LATE GREAT MULTITALENTED SILKY SULTRY VOICE MS. PHYLLIS HYMAN PERFORMS SHE SING BEAUTIFULLY AND SHE LOOKS GLARMOUROUS. PAULA KELLY IS ON HERE SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. EVERYONE ON THIS VIDEO DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKES BROADWAY MUSICALS AND IT IS A TRIBUTE TO DUKE ELLINGTON. THIS IS A SAVVY, AND SOPHISTICATED MUSICAL YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT!!!!!BRAVO! BRAVO!
__label__1 Confused and contrived: What a load of old cobblers! This is like watching 6 short films strung together and not one of them has anything to do with another. There is no consistency here. It's just another reason why music video clip directors should not be allowed to make films.Ask anyone why he or she liked this film and the standard answer is "I thought it was interesting." 'Interesting' is how you describe bad haircuts when you don't want to offend.Malkovich and Cusack should be ashamed of themselves... oh no, they already did Con Air. That was enough.
__label__2 Never Too Much: Hitchcock excels in this remake of The Man That Knew Too Much. In classic Alfred Hitchcock style, the film takes us to Africa and Europe while keeping us hot on trail. Suspense, glamour, star quality, and depth all make up this great sleeper.
__label__1 Maybe I have to try it again: I read the first 125 pages of this book and wonder what all the delirious reviews are about. To me, it's just dull and I can't seem to develop any interest in the story or the characters. I usually trust the reviews posted here. And Pulitzer winners always spark an interest in me. For now, I'm putting it away... maybe try to read it again some other time.
__label__2 It's really a good book: I am twelve years old and I just finished the book. It was a good book based on the author's experience as a Jewish child during the second world war. Annie de Leuuw was about nine years old when she went with one of her two sisters into hiding. They were at the Hanniks' first and eventually went to the Oostervelds'. It's a brilliant book and I would recomend it for ages 10-14. Anyone can read it but it's more for young adults.
__label__1 Probably would not buy again: I bought these curtains hoping to keep the light out of my daughter's room. In the summer, she goes to bed before it is dark.The curtains are not lined and do not do a great job of keeping light out of the room. And since they are cotton, it is very diffucult to iron and keep the curtains from being wrinkled if you open the curtains during the day.On a positive note, the yellow is a very nice color and the fabric is a good quality.
__label__1 Not what I was looking for...: This book is great for people who need serious organizational help. It provides lots of useful tips. I, however, was looking more for information on how much time I am realistically going to have to spend on my home business, and the most efficient way to allocate that time, rather than how to use a day planner and how to organize a cupboard or closet, etc. I pulled a few good tips out though.
__label__1 Disappointing: There were some great shots, not doubt, but it was just a remake or reedited version of Planet Earth! I loved James Earl Jones voice for sure but most of the scenes were kind of depressing and violent. I wish I could get my money back but I'll just sell it or give it away.
__label__1 BORING MOVIE...: THIS ONE OF THE MOST BORING MOVIES, I'VE WATCHED IN A LONG TIME. IT STARTED AWFUL! IT'S BORING ME TO TEARS! I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING. I'M DISAPPOINTED.
__label__1 Worthless: Dont waste even a penny on this kendle version. Poor snanned copy. Lots of garbled words. Not worth the effort of clicking the buy button.
__label__2 Zemlinsky (The Dwarf / Ullmann: The Broken Jug): Passionate and enchanting best describes this rare performance by opera tenor Rodrick Dixon and Mary Dunleavy. An amazing and dramatic performance by baritone James Johnson as well as an excellent orchestration by the L.A. Opera musical director James Conlon.
__label__1 Same at Titan Delux - Don't buy it.: I bought this car seat after reading the Consumer Report Reviews that the Titan 5 was so great. It's possible that the base model Titan is better, but it looked very uncomfortable to me, and we are in the car a lot, so I went for the delux model. The leg straps are possitioned really badly, they go over the baby's thighs, not their hips. I have a very tall 5 month old, and he was really too big for it in the rear facing position as well. I brought it back and got the Triumph 5 - and that seems much better.
__label__1 Make sure you buy a used copy.: You can find this game really cheap used if for whatever reason you actually want to buy it. The graphics are reminiscent of PS2 or Xbox1. I beat this game in 3 hours.
__label__2 Eclectic and energetic: Though I think it's too early to coronate "Grand National" as the best effort by the John Butler Trio, I think one could argue that it is their most consistently musical effort to date. Augmenting John Butler's whiplash playing of his acoustic guitars with a fuller array of instruments layers the band's sound, and his trio mates really step up as well.Sometimes the marriage of rock `n roll and social and environmental injustices either smacks of self-righteousness or ceases to be graceful and fluid. For the most part, Mr. Butler sidesteps those hindrances yet he does stumble a bit on the awkward, even embarrassing second track Daniella.But it's pretty easy to put those sorts of moments in the rearview mirror when the JBT hits full throttle on Funky Tonight, the kind of song that energizes the inner whirling dervish in us all.If I were to sum it up in two words, I would offer eclectic and energetic.
__label__1 It never worked: I am tired of these kind of companies that try to put defective product withtout QC. This humidifier did not collect any water from days of running. The 1 star is just for good look.
__label__1 Didn't meet expectations: This book didn't have the information in it that I needed on how to prepare invitational services. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
__label__2 Refund: How about giving me my full refund on my purchase,that was double shipped and answer my E-mail. I simply refused to accept the second delivery. I was charged $3.99 for not accepting the delivery. I won't be making any more purchase's from Amazon, because of the way my refund was processed. Amout of refund $65.00 should have been $68.99.Order No.103-7631631-2918225
__label__2 DVD John Wayne movies: My husband will be receiving this set in April 2011 for his birthday. I have not yet played the movies.
__label__2 "Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal."-Albert Camus: This movie is the story of two strangers who become friends and get over their weaknesses, guilt and uncertainties. For once in their lives, the two friends decide to stop making decisions, since all their previous choices were wrong and together they start an unforgettable journey of becoming themselves, not what others wanted them to be.Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti deliver an excellent performance of a smart, funny and sensitive story. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is no surprise that this movie didn't get the attention it deserves; for truly the masses only notice normal things.
__label__2 Great Movie: Great movie actions scenes are authentic This vesion of the hulk is better than any previous version and the black widow never looked sexier
__label__2 Strong batteries: These are high quality rechargeable nickle metal hydride D sizers. 11,000 mAh rated will give you a strong long lasting battery. The more mAh the better, about 12,000 is the tops for D size. Stay away from D sizes that have a low mAh rating such as 2,500 or 3,000 you be cursin' their short life span between charges. Maha makes a proper battery charger for these highly rated mAh batteries. Chech out the C808M charger.
__label__2 Happy 20 years!: They just turned 20 and I only recently discovered them while in England and loved em!had to get the video in USA format!
__label__1 What the hell is this?: This album seemed to be forced. It just wasn't them. They made songs like "One", "Fight fire w/ fire" and "Battery", then they make this poor excuse for a heavy metal album. By the way, I DO NOT CARE THAT THEY CHANGED THIER LOOKS! Just because a person gets thier hair cut and blah blah blah, doesn't mean a damn thing to me. Load was a good album, this is the weakest metal album I have ever heard.
__label__1 Worst Matrix product ever!: Where do I start? It is such a contradiction to its name. My hair became ultra frizzy and unmanageable after using this product. The irony is that my hairdresser recommended it to me because of frizz! My hair started falling after starting on this shampoo-conditioner regimen and I am stuck with this huge bottle (my bad!) for the next three months. In my defense, I trusted this product blindly because of the Matrix tag. From now on, I am going to stick to Biolage. That is the best hair product I've ever used on my hair!And oh yes, I am going to change my hairdresser too.
__label__2 Pleased with item: I am very pleased with the Conair BC84SCS Instant Heat 3/4" Hot Brush. I was happy with the description of the item and the speedy delivery, price was great, too.
__label__2 New Found Land: As one who just discovered Annie Proulx after Brokeback Mountain, I feel I have found something new and wonderful. The Shipping News has been out since 1995. How did I overlook this gem ? . The sense of place, the sights, the sounds and the smell of Labrador are all there. Creating an unpredictable cast of characters is the gift of this storyteller.A profoundly enjoyable read...
__label__2 Great Buy!: My kids (5 and 2) absolutely love this CD and ask for it every time we get in the car. All the songs are catchy and not overly sappy so it's okay for the adults to listen to as well. "Miami Grammy" and "Taxi" are two of our favorites! I would highly recommend this for all families.
__label__1 Poor Ernest: I saw this at the American Film Market, while i was working/ slaving at it. HAHA. well, it is awful. I sat and watched it with the actors and the film maker. and poor Ernest Borgnine. Of course had to tell them i liked it. but it was god awful. Very fake looking and hokey. A very poor rip off of ET. Even Mac and Me is better. But they did give out stuffed turtles at the screening and i still have it.
__label__2 Great!!!: It is an awesome CD with awesome songs. I recomend it to anyone who likes country music! I especially love his remake to Ty England's "I'll Take Today" very nicely done! hope to hear even more out of this great artist!
__label__2 Just Wondering: I think the movie is kinda a kip off of a nother movie but this one is better and the band in the move is very good and so are the songs and if anyone knows the name i would like to know
__label__1 Short use by date: Each roll of film had only two months before it's use by date. Film available at a local drug store had a remaining use by date of almost two years. I did contact online retailer concerning this extremely shoet use by period and was told "sorry".
__label__1 Bottled Blond Kiss: At first when I heard here Me Against the Music song, I thought it would be okay. But then I remembered all the stuff about her kissisng Madonna. Also here video for that song was really gross. The end was just like on stage. Although Britney did kiss Madonna, I kind of have simpathy for her. Nothing ever came up about Madonna kissisng Christina. Well, I found the picture of Madonna kissing Christina the same night she kissed Britney. Plus, all the songs on her cd are really babish. They all sound as if she were eleven years old. Sorry Britney but after hearing about the Playboy thing and crap, I was just a bit grossed out. She'll be out of business before you know it.
__label__2 Wonderful book!: Booker T. Washington shares in this book his thoughts on education and work in such a beautiful positive way. Each pearl of wisdom is such a treasure, I wish that this book could be instituted as required reading for all students. I loved it and have since bought 6 books to give as gifts.
__label__2 Everyone who likes U2 and/or good music, achtung!: Achtung is U2's second best album to The Joshua Tree, so, if you're getting into them, get the latter, then the former. Anyway, I'm getting off track. This is just really cool. It starts out with Zoo Station which sends chills up my spine, goes through some great rockers, then ends with the slow "Love Is Blindness". Yet, one thing I realized while listening to this was; this is wierd. Really, really wierd. But it's great. Get it now, even though it takes a few listens to appreciate. It's worth it.
__label__2 Great book on New Mexico culture!! Recipes too!!: This book has the recipe for Bizcochitos!! W00t!!! If you want AUTHENTIC New Mexico (along with the LARD)recipes..this is the book.....written in 1931....Great gift for any New Mexican too....
__label__2 Reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite But Actually Entertaining: I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I like Jack Black but watching his movies are hit or miss. Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are horrible. This movie falls closer to the great side. Its not hysterically funny but it is certainly entertaining and worth a watch. The acting and dialogue is very reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite, which could be expected since both movies are produced by the same people. The acting is bad but intentionally so and the story is original. Overall I really enjoyed this flick and do recommend it to others.
__label__1 Wrong shipping address: When I ordered this magazine, I neglected to give the shipping address of the person that recieved the gift.I sent an e-mail to you and asked to correct that and mail it to Cheryl Eaton, 21 Tarbox Rd. Jericho VT,05465. The "Inc" magazine was mailed directly to her, but the "Entrepreneur" magazine came to my address yesterday. Would you please correct this and be sure it gets mailed to Cheryl Eaton at the above addres in the future. Thanks for your attention in this matter. Ingrid Samuelsen
__label__2 Interesting: more of a concept album than anything else. An obscure group you would not mind being the only person to know about it
__label__1 High expectations - did not deliver: I really enjoyed Salinger's more popular Catcher in the Rye and wanted even more of Salinger to get my hands on. Quirky (as usual), despressed, and anti-climatic I did not enjoy Nine Stories. Would not even recommend as a light read to a friend.
__label__2 Amazing late-night groove soundtrack!: Smooth beats followed by elevating melodies. Great for evenings alone or to be shared by the sedated few... If you've ever wanted to know what the future should sound like... this is the formula!
__label__2 perfect for Project Life: Using this as part of my Project Life 2013 tool kit. It's the perfect size for nice little rounded corners.
__label__2 The Catholic Sanctuary: I have always been interested in the effects of the Second Vatican Council and this book is another good source.
__label__1 So much for additional order items delivered promptly: We ordered the spade with the demolition jack hammer in December. No word as when it will be shipped. It was a special deal add on to the jack hammer at little or no additional charge so I guess they just didn't like the idea so are ignoring us. Bad customer service.
__label__1 Horrible Sound: You can only just hear the lead instrument playing... I *think* the music is really good, but you wouldn't be able to tell by this recording
__label__1 A slow five years: This is the story of the trials and tribulations of a couple consisting of an American and an English woman. He is living his dream job and is about to be promoted, but he gives it all up when his fiance gets a job in cold Minnesota. He follows her as she follows her dream. So that pushes back the wedding. They have lots of good reasons for postponing their wedding, everything from moving, to injury and even a breakup. This is a painfully long, slow and dull movie. It has witty moments, but nothing that feels laugh out loud funny moments. More like amusing. The two main characters are to normal and or bland to be all that captivating for a romantic comedy that is longer than 2 hours. Thankfully they have a cast of quirky fun characters that make them look even blander.Please pass on this movie, you feel every minute of the 2+ hours.
__label__1 Disappointing: I'm referring to the 1986 edition here, and perhaps later editions have resolved what seems to me a problem - too many of the illustrations (about half) are in black and white, and the descriptions on the pages facing them are not too helpful. A page labelled 'Hairstreaks, Coppers, Blues and Giant Skippers' faces a page of black-and-white illustrations; the only hint as to what color any of these butterflies may actually be is next to the one named Ferris's Copper: "duller, more grayish than that of Ruddy Copper." Ruddy Copper itself is indeed illustrated in color - 10 pages earlier. If I'm following some butterfly around, trying to identify it, it will certainly proceed to another yard before I can find a helpful color illustration of a similar butterfly or refer to the fuller descriptions in the front and back of the book. I'm not in this to catch them, just to see if I can figure out what's flying through here.
__label__2 Little Girls will love these...: I purchased several sets of these Fairy Friends after Christmas for a great price. They are put away for birthday presents. The fairies are all lovely and appear very well made. Your little girls will love them...
__label__2 Gifts: I ordered 3 of the same book because this book helped get to a place of forgiveness in my life so I could become freed.Because unforgiveness in my life was only hurting me not the people who hurt me. I heard it put this way, unforgiveness is like me drinking poison and expecting the people who hurt me to be affected, but the poison was in me not them. I was hurt by it not them.Anyway I bought these 3 three books because I wanted to help some people who were struggling with unforgiveness in their life. Well 1st copy was in perfect condition and 2nd copy was good condition I gave them out. But the 3rd copy not nice enough to use as a gift so I didn't give it away.But I'm glad to have received each copy because they were had to find.
__label__1 Completely worthless.: This CD teaches you no vocabulary at all. All you do is listen to a frenchman babble on relentlessly and you don't have a clue what he is saying. Sure, if you want to learn to pronounce incomprehensible words, its fine but if you want to learn french it is worthless and I have had plenty of french classes in my time.
__label__2 TIGHT: YO, THIS CD IS PRETTY TIGHT, NOT AS GOOD AS HIS OTHER ONES BUT STILL A MUST GET IF YOUR A LIL ROB FAN. HIS LYRICISM HAS DEFFANTLY GOTTEN WAY BETTER.
__label__1 Yoga mat is now a rug: I am disappointed with this yoga mat, I do not recommend it. It is slippery and hard to use. After storing it for months, I now use it as a rug.
__label__1 Mala: Contrario a los comentarios anteriores, esta pelicula es bastante mala, actores fingidos y dialogos rebuscados. Fray martin aparece aqui casi como hechicero, brujo, agitando un manojo de hierbas a los enfermos. la ridicula voz que le ponen a los a animales es otro punto que mas que risa, me da trsiteza. Nada que hacer con la hermosa y llena de contenido pelicula "Fray Escoba"
__label__2 good small book: Small, concise. Binding and small size doesn't allow you to open it up flat without damaging binding.
__label__2 Wasn't bad: I don't know what possessed me to buy this cd. None of the songs besides "Idiot" really stood out, but this cd doesn't seem to be about songs so much as sound. It's not a sound one associates with today's Mudvayne, but Chad's vocals are recognizable if a little less refined (he obviously runs out of breath a few times). Didn't like the huge interlude track, but the Future Evolution mix of Dig wasn't bad, it's fun to play at a party. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes thrash metal.
__label__2 Great ACTION-PACK Film with a GREAT STORY!!!!: At first, I was not sure if FAST FIVE would be worth my time but after watching it; I wanted more. There is plenty of action from the sick driving scenes to the hardcore fights free-for-all. From the beginning to the end this movie does keep you on your seats waiting for the next plot turn. The Rock, to me, stole the show. His kick-ass take no prisoners until the job is done mentally is GREAT. The ending after the credits is a must see and leaves you with more questions than answers. This movie is a great pick for a rental or too own you can't go wrong with either decision.
__label__2 GREAT COLLECTION: Danyel Gerard. French singer. His number one and worldwide hit entitles this album. This song was recorded the year 1971 and performed by this same singer in different languages. Including Spanish, English and German. This is a jewel for French and European Music collectors. Very hard to find. If available get it as soon as possible.
__label__2 Good Product; Saves money: Once I got past understanding the intructions. I was just fine. My Garments came out fresh smelling and clean. I used it on my work jackets, sweaters and dresses, skirts, tops even jeans. I was pleased. I must admit though i havent tried it on really heavily stained or heavily soiled garments.
__label__1 UGH!!!!!: I really do not know why I keep buying this author's books. I really was hoping that this story was better than the last, but I still feel like it was a ruined storyline. What is the deal with the language that is used by her? I have finally learned my lesson and I will not be purchasing anymore of her books. She really just ruined a great family story that had so much potential. The book was all over the place. You have one person's thoughts two days ahead and then jump back to the other's person's thoughts for today. JUST UGH!!!!! I don't know what type of reading all these other reviewers are used too, but this is not a good style of writing. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I will stick with my other romance authors from now on.
__label__2 REFRESHINGLY DIFFERENT AND FUN TO READ: I've read all of the books in this series except for "Wisdom" and I just ordered that one. These books by Petra Eiko are so refreshingly different and fun to read. This is a great collection of information in a conversational approach that makes you think and feel good about yourself and helps you through problems in your life. I can't wait for the next book by Petra Eiko.
__label__2 Good Job Amazon: The Ipod i got was used but it works like its new, Amazon will provide you with top rated items, I like it so much, im about to get more things for my ipod and some other things too, shooooooot its good stuff
__label__1 "Perfect"? Yeah, right: I know that if I was looking for fantastic BB's, I should have spent more money on them. However, these BB's are barely functional. They jam up in my AEG and are only accurate to within 10-15 ft. So, yeah, I definitely would never use the words "Perfect Grade" to describe them.
__label__2 total body workout: If you really want to work your whole body, you need to get this tape. You'll burn calories and tone your body with this interval training workout. She combines aerobic exercise with weight training. At the end she has this really, really great workout for the abs, prepare to be soar the following day.
__label__2 [Four stars out of Five] All 12 seasons in one package. "Book 'Em Danno!": Hawai'i Five-0 fans may want to get this forthemselves and send out the other separateseasons as gifts!There is also a very worthy package of the first9 seasons packaged together, since many don't likethe 10th, 11th and especially the twelfth seasons.Speaking of the 12th season, this version has adifferent cover! It has McGarrett, Duke, the Govand Carew, instead of Truck and Lori! Pick Up On It!
__label__2 Favorite book: This is my favorite book of childhood, read over and over again; it always appeals and soothes. I think it represents all that one would want for oneself, as a child, and for one's children--adventure, exploration, self-reliance, humor, sympathy. A great book, the best by this very talented author.
__label__1 Don't buy this!: I purchased this pedal for a custom rock-crawler. Looks good in the pics, but in reality this is thing is NOT what you want. Throw requires a large foot-well area, and the machining for the actuator is so rough that pushing the pedal down is difficult, if not impossible to do without filing the slide for hours.Buy a Lokar and forgetaboutit.
__label__1 sleazebag slumlord: this guy explains in detail how to take advantage of people and profit off their misfortunes. Even if you want to do this yourself, he's more interested in telling tales of conquest than offering useful advice. Don't buy this book!
__label__1 A mixed cruise: The gorgeous music is ruined by godAWFUL dialoguesequences that make you press the MUTE button.Why did the presenters do this?? The big chorusnumbers are wonderful. It's a mixed bag. For sheermusic, find another CD.
__label__2 Cheap set that I could leave in the car: Bought these so there's something I could use in an emergency when I'm away from home. I'll keep the more expensive set in the garage. These tools are made in India. Is it better than a set made in China? I couldn't tell. The chrome plating on one of the wrench I received peeled off and I have not even used it. As long as the open or box end of the tool doesn't break when I will eventually use it, I'm ok with it.Four stars for affordability and completeness of the set 9mm to 19mm (some other sets out there doesn't come with 11mm, 15mm or 16mm).
__label__2 Gilmore Girls Rock: I loved the CD. The main reason I bought the CD is that my 8 month old daughter loves the music during the episodes. I own the 1st 4 seasons on DVD and we are just about out of shows to watch. She loves the opening song and the closing credits. The only thing I was upset over was that the closing credits were not on the CD. Otherwise, it is a CD that will rock in our household for years to come.
__label__2 OYAYA belts out the Latin rhythms: Turn down your stereo a notch if you've been listening to soft jazz: Angelique Kidjo's OYAYA! belts out the Latin rhythms from cut one's 'Seyin Djro' and yes, we said 'Latin': for this African vocalist here provides a fitting acknowledgement to the Latin and Caribbean roots of African music.Kidjo's Afro-Cuban rocker is packed with beats and action and is a joyful celebration produced by Steve Berlin, best known for his work with Los Lobos.
__label__2 Great dog bed!: The bed arrived on time and is well made, my dogs, even the large ones, love to curl up in it. The pillow is not so fluffy that it takes up meaningful bed space. We have a large 55 pound rescue mutt who loves the bed so much he curls up tight as a cinnamon roll, rests his muzzle on the bedside and slips happily off to doggie dreamland.
__label__1 Nature Spirits and elementals: I doubt this man believes in these beings himself,for he is just reciting folklore.I have met them myself.In John Keel's book "Why Ufo's" and Major Jack Downings writings,the describe some strange encounters with them. This is St. George,out.
__label__1 Absolutely Sick! Best Rated as 666!: There's a curse to authors and readers who buy into this sacrilege. It's eternal damnation!"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book." Rev. 22:19.
__label__2 370z: I have been using this filter on my 370z for a while now. I cant say I feel any difference but it gives me piece of mind I am not using the dealers cheap filter.
__label__1 Worst Toaster: I've owned several Sunbeam products and have always been pleased, until this toaster. The first piece of toast is ok, but after that watch out! You have to stand over the toaster making sure it doesn't burn the toast and even if you lower the temperature, it's bad to burn one side of the toast. Toasters never last long so I decided to get a cheaper one this time around. I guess I got just what I paid for--a junker.
__label__2 An artist's perspective of Kitty City: As an artist and an animal person, I treasure this exquisite book. Not only is it beautifully painted (in the challenging medium of water color no less!) but it has a rich feel of the Medieval with its purples, golds and parchment divider pages. Hence the sub-title, "A Feline Book of Hours." I share my home with several cats as I have my whole life. This book honors cats by not just showing one's daily routine with them, but also shows the dignity, courage and humor cats possess. It also shows, from the artist's perspective, the joys of daily life in the companionship of cats and the tragedy of inevitable loss.It is a joy to see cats represented as the unique creatures that they are by one of the most gifted and brilliant artists of our time.
__label__2 STATE OF THE ART: THIS IS A ROTATORY MACHINE LIKE YOUR DENTIST USES. THIS ONE COMES WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY. IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE AT MANY DENTIST'S OFFICES AND SOLD THERE WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY. THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THE WALL CHARGER BEYOND ONE YEAR BUT REPLACEMENT IS NOT MUCH . FOR WARRANTY THEY JUST SHIP YOU A REPLACEMENT AND YOU PAY ABOUT $8 SHIPPING. MUCH BETTER THAN THE VIBRATING POWER BRUSHES SOLD AT STORES.
__label__2 essential for mom of irish twins: I have a one year old and a newborn and this stroller meets our needs perfectly. The back seat reclines flat so the little one can sleep, and my older child loves sitting up front in what he thinks is the driver's seat. I have no problems accessing the storage basket when the back seat is reclined, but I have to remember to take the smaller diaper bag, as the big one won't fit.We take this stroller shopping and to the park, it's even been to the aquarium. Maneuvering through heavy crowds can be a bit difficult, but not bad considering the size of the stroller. All in all, we couldn't live without our Duo-Glider.
__label__2 "A Falling Star" Review: "A Falling Star" by Robert Diskin was one of the most emotionally intriguing books I have ever read. The poems and photos in this book provoke powerful emotions that tend to linger on even after the book is finished. I personally reccomend this book to anyone that wants to be emotionally moved.
__label__1 Stopped working after 5 months: When I first bought this product I was happy with it. I used it about 4 times then forgot about it. When I went to use it again 4 months later the cd player did not work at all. I called the company and they offered to fix it for $15 more or I could buy a new one (didn't even offer me a discount). I said no thanks. The technician I spoke to even said that there were some models out there with a defect in them and they supposedly got them all. I do not reccommend this cd player at all. I would've given this CD player NO STARS but that was not an option.
__label__1 Beyond disappointing: I have been a huge fan of Altoids for years. I have enjoyed the peppermints, the apple sours, and even the tangerine sours. That is why I was so surprised at my reaction to these. They actually burned my mouth and made me gag. I ate only part of one and had to throw the rest away.
__label__1 it's okay: I've read many books but this one was just sad it had potential with the plot but the main characters couldn't keep their hands off each other they din't even to talk much with each other all they did together was... well you get my point. The scenes of passion were also very graphic.
__label__1 Broly (...): I noticed that Goku fans really liked this movie while Vegeta fans (like me) didn't. The movie got Vegeta's character totally wrong. I mean Vegeta may not be more powerful than Goku, but he's way meaner - but in the movie he gets all paralyzed with fear and crap. And to give credit where it's due, Goku kicks some serious (...)... but what's his finishing move? No spirit bomb, no dragon fist, no fireworks... just a stupid white-belt punch.
__label__2 Dragonball GT Final Bout: First of all i am an anime expert, an personally i think neon genises evangelion is the best anime. ok now for the review. I gave this game 4 stars, becuz it is an awesome game, and has great graphics. The downside is that you will find yourself throwing the controller against the wall when the computer counters all of your beams. but overall, it is a great game.But evangelion is the best tv show
__label__2 love it: This movie is so good. Iloved it. I watched it so many times. I wished they would come out with Lucy Seven 2.
__label__1 Disappointing: I bought this with the hope of reading an easy-to-approach book containing the current science on baby development. What I got instead was a book containing a little science and a lot of breathless commentary on how amazing babies, science, and scientists are.If you're a thinking religious person that believes science is a useful tool that does not have all the answers you probably will not enjoy this book. The authors have already come to all the conclusions for you and God has been deliberately scrubbed out (literally--they quote part of the famous Wordsworth poem "Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood" at the heading of the last chapter, but leave off the final and most significant line, "From God who is our Home.").On the other hand, if you belong to the "science is man's best hope" school of thought then you may enjoy this book.
__label__1 Alton R.: There certainly is something rotten in Denmark. It's David Tennant's whining, befuddled and bouffoonish performance playing the lead. The rave reviews are unbelievable because this is not "Hamlet." It's a tragedy, not a comedy. The actors within should have gotten the posioned-point swords in the first act. If Shakespeare were alive today, I can see him calling this version "a play by Alan Smithee." Only Patrick Stewart was on the mark as Claudis, but alas he appeared to be acting in another company of players.
__label__1 Don't waste your money.: Most of the content is offensive, I personally did not find any of it funny.I expected much more.I've seen better stuff on YouTube, this was disapointing and at times just plain gross.
__label__2 Came out more orange: I ordered this to try out henna as I've always found it interesting and this cheap alternative to a professionally done one. The product can be a hassle. The application wasn't too difficult but you should prepare to have some time on your hands as it takes a while to dry. I don't know if it's because I didn't leave it on long enough but my henna tattoos came out more orange than the beautiful brown that shows up from the ones I've seen. Overall it was a "once in a lifetime" experience for me.
__label__1 Not worth the effort: I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for! The unit is not as sturdy as I had thought, and the plate is a real pain to clean. But, it does cook food as advertised, but the actual cooking space is limited.
__label__2 An Amazing Journey to Take!: Having been an avid reader for thirty five of my thirty nine years, I can wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone wanting to partake in a journey of the mystical, the spiritual, the heart. I could not put this book down until I had absorbed it, in it's entirety, and allowed the many lessons within to enlighten my intellect. I laughed, I cried and I felt as if I were right there beside both authors as they journeyed their way into each other's hearts. The decidedly unique style with which this book was written was a pure joy to experience and I thank the author's from the bottom of my heart for having the courage to share so much of themselves so as to touch us all with the beauty of their brilliant love.
__label__1 Without Stars, she's only one star...: This is the most overrated, monotonous, and down right boring CD I've bought in the past couple years. Miss Millan's zealous attempt to sound like a hillbillie, is overwhelming. The other songs are Mazzy Star b-sides and hardly original. If there was any question as to Miss Millan's contribution to Stars, it's certainly not for the positive. In fact, I would venture to guess the most amazing Stars album is yet to come - the one recorded while Miss Millan is busy in Alabama, seeking more inspiration for her next solo effort. Maybe she should have asked Emily Haines to help out, before releasing such a polished turd.
__label__1 The product received is not the same as pictured!!: I received the product in a different package as shown in your photo or as previously ordered and received. It is substandart and a poor imitation of the product I have previously received thru Amazon. I am very aengry to have to pay so much money for such a poor substitute in a similar packaging as the original product I had ordered. Someone seems to have imitaded the "Opium" I am familiar with for over 30 years!!.
__label__1 Xerxes Persia - Question about movie: Quilmiense's comment belowrefers to Xerxes' Persiaas Islamic... this is nottrue... Islam didn't existin Xerxes' time.I have not seen the moviebut before I buy it, I needto know... does this movieshow Xerxes' Persia asIslamic ???????
__label__2 Porsche 911 Buyer's Guide: Very informative and useful. It provided just what I needed to zero in on the right used Porsche for me.
__label__2 Excellent for the price:: This monitor is clear and sharp. For the price I am extremely happy with it. Not only did it increase my viewable area, but graphics on a few of the games I play were greatly improved. It arrived at my house with no flaws and surprisingly quick and free shipping.My only complaint is: Where the screen meets the neck of the monitor is rather loose. If you don't have a very sturdy table (Which I will be purchasing soon) the monitor will shake slightly when you type. It would be nice to mount this monitor to the wall though which is also an option.
__label__1 What a disappointment!: Big hype over nothing. These books are poorly written and contrived. I have a hard time understanding how any educated adult could get excited about them. There was no way I could even finish the fourth book (I kept trying to to see what people saw in them) and will NOT read the fifth, etc. - just more of the same thing. I'm sure the only reason people have gotten excited about them is from all the publicity they have received.
__label__1 not pleased: I purchased the Braun KF587w and had to return it upon inspection as the item was clearly used and damaged (a broken water compartment lid and a scratched carafe`). However Amazon did quickly replace it. But the new one, while being unused, had a defective carafe`. While my wife was washing it a stress crack developed bown beside the handle, going under the handle. While I am very pleased with the features of the coffee maker I am very dissatisfied with the quality.
__label__2 one of the best: This is one of the best John Movies out there. I ama HUGE fan of John Wayne and Jim Hutton and this has both. Get has comedy moments with excitement and drama. Something for everyone. If your a John Wayne fan this is a must.
__label__2 You can't do better than this blackjack book.: It has been several years since I played blackjack at the Las Vegas hotels. A quick review of Lawrence Revere's book, "Playng Blackjack as a Business," quickly put me in the right frame of mind, not just to play, but to know I could win if I followed instructions. Years ago I decided that this would be the book I would use as a blackjack reference. I have never been sorry. I did not play well enough (my fault, not Revere's) to get rich. I did, however, play well enough to get shut down at two tables- one at the Stardust and again at the Thunderbird. Those that remember the "bird" know how long ago that has been. Revere, whose real name I believe is Parsons, helped me have a lot of fun at blackjack and, I am sure, kept me from losing more than I should have. If you want to enjoy blackjack, find this book!
__label__2 Great as always: This is a light moisturizer that I was recommended by my dermatologist while I was taking accutane many years ago. I've used it daily ever since. Definitely a top of the line product. I used to pick this up at the hospital pharmacy when I lived else where...so glad it's on Amazon because it's not sold in stores anywhere in my new location. Other moisturizers feel thick and gooey, this one goes on smoothly and glides over your skin. It's really easy and hassle-free to apply. Feels natural and healthy. Well worth it.
__label__2 Crowning Achievement: Gill has one of the best voices in country music plus he's one of its most gifted musicians. This four CD set is worth listening to. There are two CDs with perfect selections across the board and probably only two or three marginal cuts on the other two. "Blown away" sums it up for me.
__label__2 Wicked cool: Dack Shannon, violent, creepy, and rash, I love him! He does what the law can't. He kills the bad guys. The stories are damn good and well thought out. It is great escapism. I want to read more!
__label__1 So glad it's finally over...: Let me begin by saying:1. I am a Christian.2. I believe the Bible is a literal, wholly truthful account given to us directly by God.3. This series lowered my IQ, drained me of all energy and left me longing for the hours and dollars I invested in it.After picking up the first book I realized it was interesting though poorly written. Not wanting to start something without finishing it, I kept buying this dreck until I finally completed the series. I would not recommend these books to anyone, Christian or Non-Christian.I do think the potential for fictionalizing the story of the Rapture/Tribulation period is awesome, unfortunately these "books" fell far short of reaching any sort of literary goal. (Financial goals, of course, were surpassed.)
__label__2 REFRESHING: Thank you dear Lynna Banning for such a marvelous story ! An excellent book to spent a great afternoon with a smart Texas-Ranger and a lovely lawyer. I love it - even here in France, now, you've got a fan !
__label__1 Did Not Work for Rosacea: I have had rosacea with a great deal of redness for several years. I purchased this product thinking it might help reduce my facial ruddiness. I have gone through nearly a bar using the soap as directed everyday. I tried to use it twice a day but it dried my face too much and made it itchier so I went to once a day, before bed.My pores seemed to shrink somewhat but the redness was not reduced at all. I am very disappointed with this product. It did not deliver what it promised.
__label__1 Trite and predictable: I usually enjoy Sheldon's work. This one was so predictable I felt that it lacked suspense. He seemed to be on the MPD bandwagon and the book was just an excuse to disseminate information. His cause (and we as readers) would have been better served had he written a pamphlet on MPD and saved his talent for the kind of gripping tale he does so well.
__label__1 brutal, upsetting: I recognize that this is a classic, and can be weighed on its literary merit in that regard. From the perspective of women's history and the allegories in the story-- fine.However, this is a brutal story. The tragedy of the mother-figure losing all of her eggs to dogs, and then only being allowed to keep some of her second set of eggs is deeply disturbing to both kids and potentially adult readers. There is enough real-world tragedy without adding this story into the mix for leisure reading. Better to discuss those realities with kids, when they are old enough, than to introduce a brutal read disguised as an animal story.
__label__1 Just plain awful: A real disappointment. Terrible, and I mean, TERRIBLE, audio and video. I got my money back. Stan Kenton deserves far better.
__label__2 Born Amish: Another winner from Ruth Irene Garrett.This is an engrossing look at the many communities of Amish throughout the USA & Canada, highlighting the differences in each community. These unique aspects include the color of the buggy and whether it has a roof, the women's prayer Kapp, the Schwarzentruber strictness of literally every aspect of life's mundane necessities like hat band width or length of hem in a skirt.The children are beautifully photographed in daily activities of life, as are the families captured in working together in the fields of the family farm. The role of animals are also professionally presented in vibrant photos.Highly recommend this and every work by this writer, for all who love or are fascinated by the Amish.
__label__2 Old but good: It's very well recorded. It has the most popular songs of Salvatore. It was shipped on time and well packed.
__label__1 Disappointing mastering: Due to a technical defect during mastering,this DVD(a verbatim transfer of the old RCA/Columbia Pictures VHS program) clips off the start of the song "Maneater".Hold off on buying this 7-song collection,because BMG may someday be releasing a more extensive Hall & Oates video collection on DVD.Legal problems concerning Lightyear Entertainment's claim of a long-term license on the 7 videos included in "7 Big Ones" have BMG's DVD on indefinite hold.
__label__2 Other thoughts on Bible stories: This is feminist biblical criticism through story. The Bible is originally oral history and told from the patriarchal society's POV. Now women are beginning to tell another story and celebrate goddess/women's spirituality. Great book! Reminiscent of The Red Tent by Anita Diamant.
__label__2 Pictorial History: I loved this book,there was lots of information on the lights and the history as well.Some of them even had stories about the light keepers.
__label__2 Baccano is really good.: Baccano is a unique anime. It takes place in New York where a big mafia turf war is raging. It's about gangsters that have gotten their hands on an elixer that gives immortality. This series is all over the place. One minute it's 1700, and another minute it's 1920. Before it's over it's the 21st century. The thing i liked about this anime was the character development. Even though it's a short series they managed to cram nearly a dozen really cool characters into it. It's extremely violent, but it's also quite funny. The story has a lot of crazy twists and turns and no ending in sight. But that's the whole point. Not every story needs an ending; and this one is better without one. Everything about Baccano is great. The animation, the music, and the characters. I highly recommend this series to any anime fan who isn't a young child.
__label__2 Good, not great, but good: I've seen many Woody Allen films, and while this isn't the best, it's not the worst either. Some complain that the film is in black and white, but it didn't really bother me at all. In fact I think that it helps support the premise by giving the media driven Hollywood a very dark tone. Pretty much the only thing that bothered me was Kenneth Branagh's performance. Through out the whole film he attempts to imitate Woody's acting style and it starts to get on your nerves after a while. However the other great characters and rich plot can help you see past that. In the end I really wish I could give it a 4 . I'd recommended to fans of other Allen films, but I don't think the average movie fan would enjoy it.
__label__2 Terrific adaptation.: This writer has a fine track record of adapting moviescripts to novels. He invariably captures the spiritof the movies and his characterizations are spot on.MEN OF HONOR was another of his that was extremely wellreceived. In this instance, he does a great job ofdelving deeper into the Crowe and Ryan characters than weever saw in the movie, and explains elements that wereleft disjointed by the editing. If you saw the movie andwant to read a book that fills in the gaps, this receives thehighest recommendation.
__label__2 DESTINY"S FULFILLED--They continue making the best: I absolutely love this CD. At first I was like, "Only 11 songs!!" But then I figured that they put the best 11 they recorded or maybe the only 11 they recorded. Whatever the case may be, this CD is wonderful. I can listen to it from beginning to end. And actually, I'm bored with the singles, "Lose My Breath" and "Soldier" Either way, I enjoy all 11 songs. The rest of the album is mostly ballads; however, that's what a real soulful R&B group is about. Not only "pop songs" but real old-school R&B. I give this album 4 stars because it wasn't 100% but extremely close. Go DC3, I got your back!!!
__label__1 VERY BASIC.... VERY DISAPPOINTED!: As a government employee, I bought this book hoping it would provide some good tips on the federal retirement system. This book may help the new or very uninformed employee, but that's it. Some of the information on government benefits was just plain wrong, which is why it only gets two stars from me. As an example, it states a FERS employee can contribute a maximum of 10% to the Thrift Savings Plan each year. Wrong! An employee has been able to contribute 15% for years and I believe there is no limit in 2006. This is not good information for a book that was updated in February 2006!
__label__1 Irony defined: I'm not quite sure what to make of this author, who spews hatred of gays, minorities, democrats etc...on a daily basis from the hate radio station he owns, commenting on the teachings of the Bible.For someone who spends all his waking hours spewing hatred and divisiveness to write a book of this nature, boggles the mind. Your money is better spent reading works from someone who actually understands the teachings of the bible.
__label__2 wonderfull book: I read it and it was a an excellent book specially for who already has an previous experince with VB 6. it's woth it to buy it as a reference
__label__2 E500PTH: I brought this product with some reservations but the E500PTH turned out to be excellent. Its costly but worth the money if you want to listen to music on planes etc where there is a lot of background noise. It works far better then noise cancelling headphones and the sound is very, very good.
__label__1 Not worth the money!!: The battery was not worth the money. It only charged and held a charge one time. I would not reccomment anyone buy this battery pack.
__label__1 Tedious: I was disappointed that the tape did not have more to do with 'balance' which is why I bought this tape. It is very boring & unnecessarily repetitive.
__label__2 A great novelization, doesn't just copy the movies: When I first read this book, I expected just a description of scene setting and dialogue. But there are a few surprises that aren't always evident in the motion pictures. The authors do a wonderful job of capturing the true spirit of Star Wars.
__label__2 Best Pedometer: Simply put, this is the best pedometer that I have ever used. Its oval shape and easy settings make it a delight to use. If you are a female and don't want to wear it clipped on your slacks or even your jacket pocket, you can simply clip it on to the center of your bra and off you go. At the end of the day take it off and the next morning it has reset itself. I highly recommend this product.Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer
__label__1 Item didn't work: Item doesn't work.It came in a box shipped from China. The display remains stuck on the numbers 000 or 001 lux.Poor instruction manual and no technical support numbers to call.
__label__1 Wild Highland Rose: I love to read and I love to read historical romance novels that are set in Scotland, but this book was almost painful to get through. I think this is one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was flat and boring. I felt nothing for the hero, heroin, or the solution to the plot. I think the publisher must have printed the author's first draft by mistake
__label__2 Cool Candles: I've been pleased with these candles. They've lasted several years but we don't use them often. Very colorful and fun to watch them go from one color to the next.
__label__2 lowest price!: The Brother toner cartridge is working well. I ordered it from Amazon because it was the lowest price I could find, including shipping! It came quickly and as expected. I got the product I needed, for the lowest price I could find, AND I didn't have to leave my apartment to get it! Can't ask for more than that.
__label__2 Purely Amazing Vocals: La Toya really proves what she is made of on this album. There is something on the album for EVERYONE. Personally, I love the entire album. Some of the arrangments could be a little bit better, but the vocals alone make the songs enjoyable and amazing. My personal favorite song is "More". I think that La Toya should have maybe gone in the direction of "NON A WHATCHA DO" a little more. That song is really catchy and gives another side to her vocals. The CD is not purely for women either, with sensual tracks such as "Anything" and a song promoting men -- "Appreciate", the CD allows men to feel appreciated.Overall, this album deserves a full 5 stars; I wholeheartedly suggest you spend your money--you won't be dissapointed.
__label__2 FRANTASTIC: i really did enjoy this album this reminded me so much of Boston and also of another band called Seventh Key. It also showcased Frans' voice and also the guitar playing which was excellent.
__label__1 Drops Calls and Connects Poorly: If you are on the phone more than 20 minutes at some point the phone will start beeping and you will be disconnected for no reason. I own 3 handsets and it does this with all of them. Also, sometimes when answering the phone the connection is made so poorly that you cannot hear the person on the line. JUNK.
__label__1 ouch: ouch ouch ouch ouch ouchThey're stiff. They rub in wrong places.I've had to invest in a few boxes of callous remover.
__label__2 Javascript, VBScript, and ASP Programming: In depth programming experience in Javascript, VBScript, ASP, and Access databases (and possibly SQL Server). I highly recommend this book. It is slightly out of date, but 99% of the newer adaptations of the software (i.e. ASP.NET) were found on Microsoft's web site. Many web sites are still using these versions of the software, which is why the book is so valuable. Thank you Kathleen Kalata.
__label__2 Awesome Resource!: While the 555 timer might be a slightly outdated IC, you can still do so many things with it. That's probably why it's been around for so long! This book has lots of schematics on various 555 circuits.
__label__1 Doesn't work!!: We have been XM radio subscribers for over 2 years, via my car, and it's great. I thought this would be the perfect gift for my husband. I purchased it at an electronics retailer (glad I did). The first night, we got great reception in the cradle, but no signal on a stand-alone basis, after all that is why I wanted it. We returned it, since XM told me it was probably a faulty unit. I received another unit the next day, and guess what, no reception out of the cradle. I returned it, and got my full cash refund. I would not recommend this unit for anyone who expects a signal on a stand alone basis. There are a lot of cheaper alternatives than this. I would think XM borders on "false advertising".
__label__2 chimes large: the sound is beautiful. these chimes are really big - i guess i should have measured the length, but the cylinders are large, too. also, i wasn't expecting the darker color of the wood. it's usually blond and it didn't occur to me to check it out.
__label__1 Mis-represented product: Product Description: "Wilson Tennis Balls #T1001 3PK Hard Tennis Balls."3PK to me means 3 packs of balls, as in 3 containers. No one buys tennis balls one at a time, so using the phrase 3PK is a complete mis-representation of this product. Additionally, who would pay $10 for three tennis balls?
__label__1 Disappointing: I ordered this a couple of weeks ago and I just finished it lately. This is my first and probably last Gregory Maguire book. Since you have already read the above reviews and know the basic plot information I will skip that and give my thoughts on the book. This book is supposedly a ghost story. It did nothing to frighten you or give you that "creepy" feeling a good ghost story does. I did not empathize with the heroine. In fact, I found her annoying and not at all sympathetic. In a good thriller you should feel that the hero is in some sort of imminent terrible danger sometime during the story. I never felt that the heroine was in danger. And finally, the ending was just too convenient, like a made for TV movie.
__label__2 Peace of Mind...: In hurricane season when a storm is on the way and you need to store extra gasoline in your garage, it is much safer to use a 'safety' can like this one (rather then the standard red plastic ones you get at home depot). Made of durable metal with a self closing lid, this can makes us feel much better about storing gas under our roof. It comes with a funnel to make pouring easier, but to put the gas into your tank you will probably need an additional funnel (we bought the Plews Utility Funnel with Screen, that is made of metal with a flexible spout).
__label__1 Hello Kittys Animation Vol 4: Because the movie was poor quality almost all white You could hardly see it on the Television. it was very very light.
__label__1 I would have given it a "0", but it wouldn't let me.: This is a hideously boring book. It drags on with dull language, which can easily put one in a trance. It talks incessantly about needless things and fails to focus on important imagery.The book refers to characters as "the youth", "the thin soldier", and "the loud soldier". It is hard to keep track of the characters.The lack of intriguing language makes it difficult to focus on the redeeming qualities of the book. I, myself, only noticed one: it accurately portrayed a civil war battle.
__label__1 What a mess!: I ordered this litterbox for our girl kitty who's very picky about her litter. It worked for 3 days then it died. I haven't been able to fix it to get it working again. I don't know what's wrong with it, or if it's just a piece of junk. I wouldn't recommend this litterbox since it quit workign and I'm still trying to get it fixed. It's created a huge mess at home since it's broken! :(
__label__2 Supernatural is the so COOL! dc Talk rocks in this CD!: After listening to Supernatural again and again, I classify it as one of the coolest CD's of all times. Supernatural flows together so nicely, but all the songs are unique, so it doesn't get boring. I really think the Supernatural IS better than Jesus Freak, even though I love Jesus Freak. Supernatural is just more mature sounding, with more viariety and passion. I love every song, but I think my fave is Since I Met You, Into Jesus, Dive, and My Freind (So Long). I guarantee this GREAT CD to anyone, because they are sure to find a song that fits there likes. Supernatural is put together so nicely, and it rocks totally. Buy it, you'll love it!
__label__2 A good read as told by an insider: The PayPal Wars provides a good narrative of life inside a silicon valley startup. The story starts from the humble beginnings of yet another dot-com that garnered traction via viral marketing. However, the difference was in this company's nimbleness in maneuvering around its obstacles. The author discusses the company's various competitive responses without boring the reader with too much detail. The reader gets a good appreciation of the importance of timing in the rapidly changing Internet space.Overall a brisk and informative read.
__label__1 Mildly Entertaining: Now I understand why it's in a jewel case for only 10 bux.I very much enjoy REEL (mechanical) slots, I hardly play actual video slots in the casinos. However, the reel machines depicted in Best of Slots II share the same boring graphic and especially sound format machine-to-machine. The reels change, and the upper plate (pay) glass artwork changes. That's about it.The game play feel does not change, with the exception of only a few machines. Furthermore, the CD must be kept in the drive!I just installed "Reel Deal Slots GHOST TOWN" and have found it to be far superior in every aspect for stand alone play.
__label__1 Outdated, Useless: The productg is 15 years old and hopelessly out of date. Totally useless! There was no indication of this in the listing, and I expected a current issue.
__label__2 awesome sound: STUN has an awesome sound and i think its great how they share their own views and opinions on todays society. how they can speak out and not care what anyone thinks of them is awesome. i like the emo/punk sound they have goin and the album covers hot! its got kick ... pics n the colors are awesome too
__label__2 Darryl Worley at his best: I usually buy a cd if it has at least 2 songs on it that I love. However, on each and every album this man has, I can't stop listening to them. He talks of life, love, and the true meaning of both. His music speaks of his disease and I feel he is an inspiration, to be so sick and still keep pushing on the way he has is amazing. I would like to thank him for not letting his wonderful talents go to waste. He is amazing, and so down to earth.
__label__1 They never sent the right item.: Furniture risers - two sets of 4 each, one set 3" high, one set 4" high both cone shaped risers. The product might have been just what I wanted, but after two tries, I have given up. The company does not know what they are selling. They kept sending one set of 4 rectangular recliner risers. Even after explaining thoroughly to them, the second parcel came again WRONG. Their voice mail system is rather bizarre. It gives you a list of numbers and methods of getting the number: massage, push, touch, etc - 8 different options, but no one ever actually came on the phone until I just pushed the O button at the beginning of the call. This place stinks.
__label__2 The First "Candide" Still Glitters: After more than half a century, the original cast album of "Candide" still glitters, so to speak. Although this production flopped on Broadway, this album has become a cult classic, primarily due to Barbara Cook's clear, sweet, and warm soprano, a "sui generis" voice, unlike the many generic Broadway sopranos of today.Although this is not my favorite "Candide" overall, the style of some of the performances being a little stilted, Cook is certainly my favorite Cunegonde.
__label__1 Tired: I was a big fan of the early Skinner books and so I thought I'd see how the series was doing. If Gallery Whispers is anything to go by, the answer is: Not well. This book suffers from terrible telegraphing of plot points, a number of the most horribly graphic sexual scenes I've ever read, and some of the worst editing/proofreading I've seen in a very long time. To say the book is disappointing is an understatement. It's difficult to keep a series fresh, which is why my hat is off to a writer like Thomas Perry who has the sense to end a series before it becomes stale and move on. Jardine would be well advised to do the same, if Gallery Whispers is anything to go by. If you're interested in reading this author, the wisest course is to start back at the beginning with, say, Skinner's Rules.Not recommended.
__label__2 Great device, good price: My wife picked this up for me for Christmas from Costco. Good deal. The maps work great. I've been using it for a month in 3 different cities and it's picked up where I was and got me where I wanted to go very accurately.The one big drawback is that this unit is gimped on the amount of memory built into it (1.5 GB instead of the 2 GB installed in the other 600 series models). I had to remove the extra voice sound files, etc in order to have enough room to install the updates from the Garmin web site.Minor gripes: It would be nice to have an easier way to create an address book and import it into the device. Multiple stop directions are possible, but a little cumbersome as you have to pick your end destination first, then 'add' the mid points afterwards. There's also no easy way to re-arrange way points once they're set up.
__label__2 Not Bad, short review with a question at the end.: Just got it for Xmas and I have to say, not a bad show. The elimination match was fun untell the end(someone gets seriously hurt), Steiner/Goldberg was kick ass. Nash/Booker was ok but to short. Bunkhouse Brawl was match of the night imo. Tons of good stuff, only bad matches are the scaffold match because its slow and the tag chain match because the same reason.The question:At the end of this video it shows a promo for Haloween Havoc 2000 and it says its coming soon to video, anyone know where I can find the ORIGINAL VHS copy?
__label__1 AWFUL! Colors not as represented!: I ordered this based on information and appearance that seemed like pages were PALE-colored and color of "steno-pad green," only to get a bright green "pastel" that hurts my eyes and is useless to me for writing on. Do not bother with these garish colors for real work, unless you are planning some artistic pusuit with them. The listing of "Pastel" is misleading (as is the picture) and JUST NOT TRUE! I was VERY disappointed, and for the OUTRAGEOUS price one would expect something more PROFESSIONAL.
__label__2 Finally my favorite show all out on dvd!: I really have missed this show and been waiting forever for it to be released and I am glad I waited until all 4 seasons (I think it's 4 seasons!) anyhow I did order it today and I am hoping it arrives tomorrow like the tracking number suggests. Long live Duckman forever!
__label__2 Not bad..: Certainly covered all the basics of combustion engines and introduced some key formulas to remember. It's a little European car centered, but engine basics are the same. It is a little dated now, first printing was in '88, so many newer technologies and recent advancements are not touched upon at all. Still an excellent resource.
__label__2 At Last!: Bria Simpson wrote the book I've been searching for! It's a quick read for busy moms but the material is a "must read". It really helped to put my priorities and values in perspective.
__label__2 Mardi Gras and Carnival.....: The sounds of the bees second disc takes me away. Sounds of carnivals or mardi gras waft and wane.This is a very pleasant disc to listen to, and given the right frame of mind, it can be almost epic.There are few bands that conjure up the 60's and 70's the way that the bees do. The harmonies are stellar, and the songwriting is a hippies delight.I would be hard pressed to find a reason why most peole wouldn't flip out for this release.Do yourself a favor and check out the new Coral disc (roots & echos). they are right there with the bees.Exhale and enjoy.
__label__2 The Hobbit Audiobook - the convenient way into 1st class fantasy....: This is very close to the original, just bringing some flavor to the storytelling without exaggerating. Is is nice to listen to, good pace and good quality. I you are interested in Tolkien, this is worth the money.
__label__1 Fragmented Content for $20 a month? No Thanks: Let me see if I have got this right.The journalists and editors write these stories on computers and same them to files. Those files then go to the print shop to be converted from digital to printed media at an incredible cost in paper electricity ink and equipment.Next they go to the Digital Publishing department (emailed to Amazon) or at no real cost upload it to amazon who then distributes the content for them from servers that amazon pays for.First they devalue it by only providing a portion of the printed copy, then they jack the price up to $20. In an age where a TV or Radio can transmit information for free, not to mention in a world where I can "Google" from just about any phone...Why in the WORLD would I pay this much for devalued/fragmented content? That's like watching a movie and NOT getting to watch the ending.On the high-end, the most I would pay is $9.99 a month.
__label__1 piece of junk: Balls wax layer is too thin, easy to be scratched. Table brush leaves more dust when you brush the table. Cues' pads are so hard and thin, very slippery when they hit a ball. Spent just a few more dollars and buy descent products. This set is a piece of junk.
__label__1 Cooled -- but finicky and troublesome.: 1.) Looks great2.) Cools well3.) Noisy on anything less that 100% level floor (carpet is not really a good floor for this model)4.) I live in a dry climate (Southern California -- no where near water -- 30% humidity TOPS) and the water container filled up overnight... even though it is not supposed to really ever fill up according to the manual.5.) The overheat switch in the power cord shut off constantly... after 3 minutes of use the first time I plugged it in.Basically, if you have a hard wood or linoleum-like floor in a room where you dont mind some noise AND you don't mind emptying the water from it by hand -- go for it.
__label__1 Not for beginners!: This workout is fun to watch but it is very hard to follow, especially if you are used to doing your workout to other videos. There is no lead-in to the change in moves; apparently, you are supposed to memorize the routine! I tried to follow but she moved too fast from move to move without any warning or explanation. Maybe it would be easy for people who are good dancers, but I'm a fitness beginner...and this one was just too hard to follow. The music is great, though!
__label__2 Gotta love Rum!: It is Johnny at his best... what this might lack in "deep story..." more than makes up for it in pure festive entertainment!
__label__2 A new perspective from a good author.: I was very heartend upon reading this book. While all of Lackey's books have been enjoyable to read many of her latters books have lacked a fresheness in there perspective. This new novel was a fresh break from her previous work. The themes are not of global scale and you could feel inimately the plight of the characters. I also was quite delighted by her choice of main character for the novel. Darian, a young mage gifted boy, is not the perfect idealistic youth most often portrayed in books of this type. Instead we are introduce to a young boy who is lazy, neglectful of duty and a bit of a brat. Watching the growth of him through the book only underlines one of the over all premisses of Lackey's books. "There is not one true way". Not in religion, politics, or the raising of a children.
__label__1 Utter effing crap.: Crap. That is as good as I can put it. Its a horrible documentary with bad sound and even worse post production. Going in the round file immediately.
__label__1 This is a cheap and tacky knockoff: I own two of the REAL Magis Bombo Stools. I've seen the knockoffs in person and frankly they're cheap, flimsy, and tacky in their workmanship. These might be appropriate for a pre-teen's rec. room, but no adult should own one.
__label__1 I Have to Abandon This One: I tried to finish this book, I really did. I love books about the Civil War and have read many. But the characters, oh dear, the characters. Was Carrie McGavock just downright nuts? She comes across that way. Some elements are confusing, such the early-on confiscation of Carnton Plantation by the Union; I didn't expect to see John McGavock again after his encounter with Union troops, and the miserable, pointless execution of a wounded mule. I don't find the characters sympathetic, just odd. The true story of this place in Franklin is probably very interesting.Fictitious or real, I couldn't stick with it. A much better book about women and the Civil War is My Name is Mary Sutter by Robin Oliveira.
__label__2 Basics Explained: My husband and I both use this text - him for the Jail/Prison ministry he coordinates and me for RCIA inquirers before we begin session in the fall. If the people who read this understand it, they're better catechized than most of the people sitting in the pews.
__label__2 WOW: I think this book is well written. some parts I did not quite understand but I still liked it. the first book was a little more interesting to me but still a wonderful bok
__label__1 The "hero" does too many stupid things!: I'm ex-military, ex-street-cop and ex-PI, and this book is so full of "investigator nonsense" it was aggravating. Very aggravating. It was also chock full of "FLUFF", namely unusually long descriptions of unrelated (or almost unrelated) stuff. Basically the author hasn't a clue of how "real investigators" operate and tries to make it up like an old lady might. If you like well written fluff filled nonsense, it's OK. But if you want your fiction to be believeable, forget this one.
__label__1 Not happy: I upgraded from a basic HP610 so I could get great color prints from my digital camera.I wanted another HP but let the store salesman talk me into getting a Lexmark Z52. It eats ink cartridges which cannot be refilled sucessfully. Constantly gives message "unable to communicate with the printer" and the color pictures and also black and white are terrible. I talked with Lexmark tech service and they had me send them some pictures illustrating my complaints and after they reviewed them phoned me to say they thought THE PICTURES WERE FINE. Unbelivable. Am shopping now for either an HP or a Canon.I have been working with this printer for 18 MONTHS so this is not a casual review after just a few days.
__label__2 great product/great service: I have ordered this product several times from this vendor it arrives every time with lightening speed - usually within one to two days. love that - hate waiting! Great vendor great stuff!
__label__2 Good First Feature film: This film is shot in black and white, the gritty nature of the contentlends well to b/w. I watched it twice and liked it even more the secondtime, the film draws you in. Very good for low budget first time fulllength movie. Well written suspense/thriller script, use of shadows andscenery done very well. Musical cues through out the film were welltimed and appropriate to mood and settings, but overall the soundneeded reworked. Actors facial expressions were captured very well,good use of close ups for personal character reactions. Very goodcharacter acting. Unique story and an interesting setting. I can'tthink of a similar story anywhere, very creative and fresh in this timeremakes and sequels.
__label__2 Kids love this classic!: It's the great classic tale of Rikki Tikki TaviWonderful bedtime story - exciting and with a happy ending.Kids want to hear it again and again.
__label__1 Didn't Work: It was wired incorrectly. I changed the connection pins to match the OEM and it still didn't work!!!!
__label__1 A Headache: Sandelan's music is nothing but a headache to listen too. This person is what gives new age music a bad name. It is the same melody over and over and over again for each track and it becomes aggravating and annoying to listen to. A trained monkey could play this so called music. One gets tired of listening to his cheap carnival like organ. Do not buy this trash
__label__1 Great Production, Poor DVD: This is a wonderful classic. I have purchased each season as it has become available on DVD. I am usually very happy with A&E's DVD's, but I am not sure what went wrong with, "Upstairs, Downstairs". Season Four had some very long periods where the picture was so blurred that it bothered my eyes to watch it. Overall, I am quite disappointed with the results on DVD. I know I will continue to purchase each season, because I really enjoyed the series when it was on television, but I wish the quality was better.
__label__2 outstanding&#65533;: I had been a Miss Fordham fan ever since her first self-title album. She has one of the most expressive and beautiful voices in the music business these days. Her new music is warm, sexy and earthy. A great musical accomplishment. Congratulations Julia!
__label__2 Gets the job done at a good price: 5 stars because it was unfair of the one rater to base his opinion on a seller who cheated him and sent a bent bar that was missing parts. Shame on that seller.I have this and I have used it and loaned it out several times and it still works. Obviously you can purchase a better one and this will not perform like this one Gear Wrench Serpentine Belt Tool 15 Piece Set but for the money you cannot go wrong.I would actually give this 4 stars because it works and will last. If you work as an auto mechanic and do the belt changes or a regular basis get the gear wrench set, for occasional use this works fine.I have seen this one go on sale locally around $10.
__label__2 Great Music, Great Band: A friend of mine at college at UMass played this CD for me, and I was hooked. Then, I happened to catch their performance at The Middle East Nightclub and was awestruck. The singer prowled the stage like a caged panther, the bass player was a mass of energy, bouncing around all over the stage, the guitar player seemed to me the most serious one in the band, added beautiful melody and sang backup vocals, and the drummer, well, he was just perfect for the band. That night, the band played a lot of new material not on this CD, but, as great as this CD is, their next one could be even better, from the songs that I heard. Either way, you need to get this CD. You won't be disappointed.
__label__2 good quality blocks: I bought these blocks after a lot of research for my daughter for her 1st birthday. I read about a lot of blocks with toxic paint and ones that the wood chips off, but these blocks have held up great! My daughter has done just about everything imaginable to these blocks and they still look great! She likes to stack them and carry them around!
__label__2 South Park: Complete 14th Seasons: It is what it is. Popeye the sailor man! It's not quit like the mormans and the 9 tony's, but it is what its.
__label__2 not same bottle: The product I got was in a purple bottle and called Healing Smoother, not Strait Line. Seems to be the same stuff.
__label__2 Hard-to-put down!: I first heard about this book from my mother who read it years ago. I finished the book in three days flat. Alternating between working/reading while at work, I could not stop reading this book. The author (also the prosecutor)did an excellent job of writing=however, she did fail to explain how Colleen Hooker was indeed the "Perfect Victim." The horrendous details of how she was captured, tortured and brainwashed for several years is unimaginable. I'm not sure if I am still in shock because she never left when she had the chance or the fact that she believed Cameron's blatant lies for so long. Either way, Colleen Hooker is a true survivor!
__label__2 Works better than generic: Good labels. Have used generic ones and they always just don't last.. peels off after time but these Averys wont do that. Important in this case since you don't want your shipping label peeling off in mid transit. Spend the extra money and get the quality you need. One lost package will cost you a lot more.
__label__1 pure trash: what a horrible rag this has become. any pretense of journalism is long gone. i don t even look at it any more.
__label__2 GREAT NOVEL: Extremely entertaining and informative - the anagrams and riddles blew me away, and the plot twists at the end were fantastic
__label__2 Great time saver: I use this product on my RV. As I travel I need to connect and disconnect my water hoses frequently. This product is high quality and works great. A real time saver.
__label__1 Same old same old.: What can I say Adam Sandler using the same voice the same body movements the same ridiculousness that he always does. It's a great movie for the unintelligent masses of sheep who will laugh at anything.
__label__2 Long Time Music Junkie: I first listened to Swim as a downloaded MP3 (Fall Into The Sea). I thought, "This is really a great song". After listening to it for a while I decided to get the CD on the hope that at least two or three other songs would be at least OK. The whole CD is very good. Some of the other songs are great! All of the songs are at least good. Can't wait for the next CD.
__label__1 Coconut powder: I expected powder not little bits that get stuck in my teeth and give my smoothie a grainy texture.Also not much cocnut flavor.
__label__1 Nice design, but the handle is too weak.: I bought this about a year ago, and I have a very few photos sorted into it, and a set of christmas cards that I have been planning on finishing for ages. The box isn't full, and sees very little use. However, the last time I went to move it, the handle broke off completely. Now it is useless. The handle is weak, and may very well break much sooner than you think. The rest of the box seems ok, and fairly study, but the handle the part that sees most wear & tear is poorly designed. I wouldn't buy it again.Too bad, I really liked the picture boxes with this, it was a good way to sort & organize projects.
__label__1 Its ok but has no handle to grip with.: Hope it works as good as it says but I can see I will be spending a lot of time picking up off the floor with no grip or handle to hold on to. Now I have to run to feed supply and get another with a handle. Wish I know that before I wasted the money
__label__2 Storm Warning (The Mage Storms) book 1: I like her writings, but haven't read this one yet. The world she has created, Valdemar, is interesting and exciting.
__label__2 One of the most amazing, life-saving self help books I've read: In this book, TD Jakes takes a very real approach, hitting on key life issues, in order to get the reader to live a more positive, goal-oriented life. I have read several self-help books and browsed many. TD Jakes real approach based upon his life experience, people he's dealt with in his ministry etc will make you want to re-read this book and keep it in your collection to refer to. He touches on major topics in our lives from the friends we keep to wasteful ways we may spend our time. I definitely recommend this book for readers of all ages and even for non-christians!
__label__1 Hardly complete: The vagueness and inconsistancy with the finer points of raising ACD's can create some real problems for those who don't realize the intelligence of this breed. Also, the history of this breed, according to this book, will lead you down the road of half truths and myths regarding the true origin of the Australian Cattle Dog. I would suggest Scott Lithgow's book, Training and Working Dogs even if a companion to this breed doesn't wish to work their dog. It has valuable information on raising this particular breed and others like them. For true history of this breed, I would suggest A Dog Called Blue by Noreen Clark.
__label__2 Love this Card.: Upgraded to this Card from a non-Rev A. card and was getting consistant DL speed of 1.4-1.6MB This speed of course is achived when used in area where you get good signal. I've used this card for about 6 months and I can only remember 1 time where it used National access in stead of broadband access(most of times, even with low signal, it still connected Broadband access) 100% satisfied with this product.
__label__2 wow: good for vulture control...charge and fire it w/o pellets sounds like a real firearm...i put a cp 3-7x red/green illuminated scope with a dove to picatinny rail adaptor on mine...
__label__1 So Slow!!!: I got this DVD in hope of learning some cool strip dancing moves. Honestly, this tape was so slow and borring. I naver made it past the third move. I would not recomend it, unless super slow is what your looking for.
__label__2 Where to begin....: Wow...it is so hard to express how awesome this CD is...I must admit to just picking this CD up a couple of weeks ago...I have been hooked on Second Stage Turbine Blade for like ever...it rarely ever left my CD player until now...This CD just blows my mind!! my favorite track would have to be...well...all of them...i cant pick one...i have turned quite a few people onto c&c that normally wouldnt be into this type of music...so even if u think this isnt ur type of music, u should listen to it anyways because i havent talked to anyone that dislikes this CD...and the idea behind all of it so such a great and unique idea...chances are that u will enjoy this cd if u pick it up...
__label__2 For when the sprayer stops working: I love my Misto. A lot.If the sprayer stops working try cleaning it out with really hot water. That should help get everything back in good working order.
__label__1 Eh: While it's clear Ms. Bender can write and write cleverly, it wasn't enough to hold my attention in this quirky collection. I found myself waiting for the next oddity rather than the next revelation. And, sadly, towards the end, I was just waiting for it to all be over. I found this especially true in her novel, which was just a very very very long quirky short story. I'm a little tired of quirky and clever, so forgive me if this review is too strident. If quirky and clever is your thing, then by all means.
__label__2 Under the Cherry Moon Review: This is an awesome album! In my opinion this is some of Prince's best work. If you're a Prince fan, you're sure to love this cd. Not only does it contain the classic song Kiss, it also contains "Likeyoueneedaholeinyourhead" (I don't know if thats the title but it is a rarely heard classic that many young Price fans may have never heard). All togeather, this project is a mix of funk, ballads and mid-range tempo jams that are sure to please and even contains a beautiful instrumental track that, once again, showcases the musical talent of Prince and the Revoloution/Parade. Cop this CD if you know what's good for you! They're selling it at a great price, too!-Ryan Lionheart
__label__1 agreed: I couldn't get through the first thirty pages of this book either. A year after I gave up on it (not just gave up, but was utterly exhausted, irritated, and distressed by it) the author is on Oprah in a room full of women who call "Eat Pray Love" their bible. I logged on to find out if I'm the only person who found Elizabeth Gilbert to be, well, self-absorbed, self-obsessed, afraid of her own company, unable to see outside of her own drama. I am relieved to have found so many similar reviews. It makes me sad that women cling to this book as some kind of instruction manual on how to find rightness in their lives. P.S. Ms. Gilbert makes the same impression on Oprah as she did in the book.
__label__1 Terrible: Is it possible to give a movie a rating of less than 1 star? This movie will have to go in the top ten as one of the worse ever made.
__label__2 Celestial Bubble Gum for the Spirit: While serious critic decry Mr. Lynch's work as "average", its popularity should tell you that these cheerful melodies are hitting the right note with many listeners. Does music always have to be complex or deep to be good? A roaring pop music industry should tell anyone that it doesn't.So Ray Lynch doesn't write complex music. That's not a bad thing . "No Blue Thing" is listenable, especially the best piece on the album "The True Spirit of Mom and Dad." The two voices, high violin and deep synthesizer seem to represent the character of two loving and influential parents, traveling through happy and serious times. My favorite, however, is "Evenings, Yes" which has a meditative oboe solo and is very pretty. It'ssomething to listen to when doing yoga or relaxing. A pleasant album for fans of synthesizer New Age.
__label__1 Yeah... they're rigid: I had no idea that fabric could be this stiff. They remind me of those uncomfortable tough jeans from when I was a kid except I think these are stiffer.I had to wash and dry them 5 or 6 times before they could be worn - just kept cycling them through with other loads of laundry. Even with all that washing, they are still stiff but they can be worn.The cut is very full. I thought they would shrink up more than they did. It probably would have been a good idea for me to order an inch smaller than normal in the waist.So -They are ok.They are more rigid than I'd like.They will probably wear well and last a long time.They will be worn, but I wouldn't want to purchase another pair of these.
__label__1 Most disappointing of the Eddy-Mac musicals: The story is so fractured......and much as I love Tosca......this is not the place for it. Some segments on their own are good, but it doesn't hang together as a whole. And the stupid totem song with the Indian segment was totally ridiculous. Leave it to Hollywood to screw up a good musical.For a fine musical with Jeanette as an opera singer, see Maytime.
__label__1 Life is hell and then you die: It's true that that the characters exist for the purpose of delivering long philosophical rants decrying thetheir existence along with everyone else they know. Of course this story takes place in the shadow of theholocaust which effects their every moment of their existence. It was understandably impossible for themto form relationships, or experience happiness based on the unspeakable trauma they experienced.They escaped the holocaust but the ghosts but they were driven by the ghosts of the past.This was a very heavy book and I felt relief when it was over. Would not recommend ifyou have a history of depression.
__label__1 Great for me, but not for the other party on the line....: I purchased this speaker for my car because I have a slight hearing loss and my girlfriend had one that she used one day when I was present - the speaker was loud and clear.So I quickly ordered one -- well, guess what? It was true -- when I was using it the person I was speaking with came through loud and crystal clear. However, every single person I spoke to either complained of an echo, a rattling noise or "a sound like marbles rolling around." I think it was picking up vibration from my visor because when I took it off and held in it the palm of my hand they said it was markedly improved.But then ... that kind of defeats the purpose of the speaker in the first place, now doesn't it?
__label__2 HP continues to be #1 for high end calculating: I was a 10-year user of a 48g. Got the 49g+ to catch up with the times, love it. Back in school of a EE degree, use it every day, very powerful. I've had it for a month and already it has outpaced the TI, which isn't a bad calculator, it just that for the professional/engineer type this HP seems so much better. In fact I've already managed to convert 2 long time TI users. Once they saw what this HP could do they realized the myth/ledged was true. Other stuff - keyboard is fine & the SD card is great, right now my calc has 512 mb of storage. Wow. As far as RPN, give it two days and you'll never change back. Great buy.
__label__1 It can't tell time!: The clock can not tell the correct time. The arrows will be placed at 3:05 for example and then the thing announces it it 3:40. It does this consistently no matter what mode it is in "Quiz Qame" or "Tell Time". We put fresh batteries in it and it still has never been correct once. The thing is a joke!
__label__2 Pop music at it's best: Ron Sexsmiths first album is just excellent pop music. His tender voice fits perfectly for his selfpenned songs. If you want to relax and have a good time, just put on this superb album.oddik 3080
__label__2 Handy Dandy: I love this! It looks so clean and crisp and can hang either in the closet or on one of my racks near my bed. I use a Joy Mangano Huggable Hanger to put it on and it is extremely stable. The snaps are very sturdy and it can be rolled up if you want. I actually got two when I ordered and use one for earrings and watches in the bigger bottom pockets and the other one for necklaces, and rings with bracelets and larger pendants in the bigger pockets. I ordered it through AntOnline and they were super fast with their shipping.
__label__1 No plastic window: Just has a hole in the metal for the screen, no clear plastic protection. Also has a removable plastic spring clip on the back, not a wrist cord like in the picture. Caveat emptor.
__label__2 How to Fight Cancer and Win by William L. Fischer: This is an excellent sopurce of supplemental ideas that can go right along with the conventional means of treatment as well as a guide to prevention of cancer. I believe it to be balanced and coming from a common sense approach.
__label__2 Better then his Carnagie Hall Concert: I was very undecided whether to purchase this album or not. I was not a big fan of Victor's Carnagie Hall concert CD. However, this one was done correctly. Victor starts off shaky but in then end show how great his talent is. The songs that make this CD worth purchaing are Tengo Ganas, Nunca Habia Llorado Asi (with Don Omar), He Tratado, Hay Que Poner El Alma, and Puerto Rico (with Gilberto Santa Rosa, and Eddie Palmieri). This concert was way better then his Carnagie Hall concert, recommended.
__label__1 Good Sound, Easily broken: I have used these speakers for over a year. It has great sound, however, it's given me more frustrating moments than I can count. If the wire is not correctly positioned, sound from the left speaker will not function. The subwoofer also disconnects at times. This can get incredibly annoying day after day. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and bought a new speaker set.
__label__2 Crush - good album, but not Bon Jovi's best: When Bon Jovi declared that they were going back to their slippery when wet days, I was excited. Unfortunately, Crush is NOT a return to slippery when wet days, it is a modern pop-rock album. It is not dark and gloomy like These Days, but it does not rock like New Jersey/Slippery or even Keep The Faith. The lead single It's My Life is the most rocking track. Curiously, the 2 bonus tracks (Neurotica and I Could Make A Living Out Of Loving You) for Australian/Japanese versions are stronger than some filler tracks in the album. The second single to-be (Say It Isn't So) is catchy but does not rock hard. The best tracks are It's My Life, Just Older (classic Bon Jovi), the ballad Thank You For Loving Me and the final track One Wild Night. Some other tracks are okay and catchy (Say It Isn't So, Captain Crash) but the rest are just fillers.
__label__2 A sweet and comfy read: A cozy story about friendships and babies! The characters were very believable and well-rounded with great stories, even if a couple of the plots were tiny bit predictable. I wish there had been more involvement with the knitting angle. All the male love interests knights in shining amour, but I guess we need that every now and then. Regardless, this is a sweet book that will leave you feeling inspired and happy!
__label__2 Great for easy frying and clean up: I purchased this machine a few months ago. For the most part I am pleased. The only real problem for me is like all the deep fryers I have seen, you can't cook for a whole family in one batch.It could also use some cooking ideas.Cleanup is the best thing about this fryer.
__label__2 The effect is very good ~!: The effect is very good, more than the imagination, amazing. Bedtime daub to scar mark it, and the next day he found blain to imprint desalination many, very good things, and recommended.
__label__2 Amazon and Hoover rate 5 stars: I purchased the SpinSweep two years ago from Amazon and wore it out and now have ordered my 2nd Pro from Amazon again. Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Open the package and used it right away sweeping acorns on my driveway. Fastest way to clean your driveway and sidewalks from acorns, leaves, dirt, grass clippings etc.Cmunn - Florida.
__label__2 Good: Overall, not a bad book.Does an excellent job of compiling all the "arcane" knowledge of how to plan for a LAN Party. Goes into some of the specifics of IP configurations, etc but leaves the reader hanging dry when it comes to managed switches and routers. I believe that the writer would have at least recommended some other books on the subject or maybe some online references.There are some very useful tips on how to keep your LAN Party guests entertained and I am sure to utilize them on a LAN Party being planned.Definitely an excellent reference for a "noob". Have fun!
__label__1 Disappointed wannabe: I live in NW Montana... NO coverage unless I go about 50 miles into Idaho. I know I can download to my computer, but our DSL company has also decided to "limit" our download. So... no instant newspaper, blog, or magazine. It would be a book Reader, only. Pretty expensive for that.I was sooooooooooo excited when I heard about the Kindle. We have such limited access to things, here in the middle of nowhere, I thought this might be the perfect answer.Will coverage improve?
__label__2 Intense record: Sabotage/Live has superb songs performed in a brutal manner. If you feel as though you don't fit in, then you may enjoy this album because John Cale sounds like he's shouting from a place of isolation and outrage.
__label__1 Numb Fingers: Bad, very bad. My fingers were numb within 5 minutes because the buttons are so hard to press. Also, the battery compartment sticks out underneath, making it uncomfortable to hold. Ended up with the Logitech PS2 Cordless Action Controller, which has beautifully responsive buttons and a great feel (but get the newest, smaller one - it has blue stalks on the joysticks).
__label__2 not good for noisy environment: The product works good at distance but I am unable to hear music while riding my lawn mower.
__label__1 Does not work: This product simply will not work for me. I've tried virtually every fix listed in the other reviews, but I still cannot get my Nintendo 3DS or Nintendo DS Lite to connect to the access point. Some people have managed to get this product working after screwing around with it for a while but I am not one of those people. I would not recommend it at all.
__label__1 Not Comprehensive as the Title Claimed: Anyone looking for a comprehensive pattern making would be better off go for other books i.e. that of Helen Joseph Armstrong, or Winifred Aldrich.Basic Sloper in page 34 where HI measurement (chest line) is taken 3 in below A (neck point) seems to be too generic for a comprehensive pattern book, I suppose.There is no children pattern included in this Comprehensive book either.
__label__1 Time travel killed Eureka: In season 4, the central cast members travel back and forth in time to return to a Eureka that has been altered due to their time travel. The characters have to figure out what has changed while at the same time trying to function in their new lives. It's obvious that the producers of the show used this time travel twist to re-envision the characters and breathe fresh life into the show. Instead, they ensured the show's demise. The time travel twist is just plain lazy, and week after week it is increasingly irritating to watch each character have to figure out what has changed from their original past. After the viewers invested three seasons in learning and loving the characters and the town, the show's producers give the fans the middle finger with a stupid time travel twist. The show easily gets 4-5 stars for the first three seasons. However, it is generous to give season 4 even two stars.
__label__2 Famous People: Haven't watched "Purple Rain" yet on this DVD set, but I have TRIED to watch "Fame" and I was unable to finish the movie due to a glitch on the disk. I am a fan of both movies though!! The music and dancing makes you want to get up and join in on the excitment!!
__label__2 Cant stop reading: This series is the best series of books i have ever read. Every time ai finish a book in the series i want to read the next book. The socerers stone is probaly one of the best books. It is very decriptive and gives you the oputunity to see the book on your mind. Once you start this book you better make sure you have nothing to do with in a few hours because you will never ben able to put this book down. so final statement is this ios a must-read!(i reccomand to get next book in series because series just keeps getting better!)
__label__2 Easy Read: I always enjoy Karen Kingsbury's books. I loved the Redemption series with the Baxter family. A great mix of what real life is with it's ups and downs!
__label__2 EXCELENT PERFECT FABULOS SUPER: I loved this book! I read the first Egerton hall book, the Tower room when i was bored one day and i couldn't but then down untill i read this one. Bella is just me I love her and the ending is sooo Sweet BUY BORROW OR STEAL THIS BOOK,AND THE TOWER ROOM AND WATCHING THE ROSES AS THEY ARE MUST READ
__label__2 As great as always: Definitely again an awesome EJ mood, with that wit and slight taste of bittersweetness that you conjure up when you grow old and look behind.I totally adore "Answer in the Sky", and "Weight of the World". Some typos in the lyrics, but nothing serious.
__label__1 Lid is a pain in the a***!!!: Yes - as others have already commented, don't waste your money. I am using this item today for soup and I cannot get the lid off. I'm completely frustrated...and hungry! I do remember using it last year and thinking my food did not feel warm after three hours in the container, but thought I'd give it another go...complete waste of time.
__label__1 Ambiguous and Expensive: I looked at this plan for my Sony LCD TV purchase. It is not clear if this is an in-home plan or we have to ship the product. The 'Qualifying Products' for in-home service is not defined. Called them up but could not get any direct answers. In the list of items covered, it does not say if pixel-burnout will be treated as a replacement (this is a must if you are buying an LCD system).Also the same plan is available from Sony directly for $229.They also have another plan for $199 that covers 'Audio/Video'. Whether it covers TV's not sure. Another post on this board claims that it is the same.I would avoid dealing with such ambiguous contracts.
__label__2 Much Better Than "Fridge Phonics": My daugter received both the Word Whammer and Fridge Phonics for her second birthday. The Word Whammer has three modes. The first mode is almost identical to the Fridge Phonics set. The song is a little bit shorter, but it sings the letter name and the sounds it makes. If you press a letter twice, it has a phrase with that letter, something that the Fridge Phonics doesn't do. For example, the "c" is "It's c-c-c-c-old in here!". The "a" is "aaaaaaah! I'm scared of monsters!". It's very cute. The second mode is for making words. If you just put in one letter, it will prompt you to put a vowel (a "blue letter") in the second spot. When you spell a word, it sings a short song. In the third mode, it prompts you to try to spell words that rhyme. It is a great toy with much more "grow with me" potential than the Fridge Phonics.
__label__2 Madonnafan: I think most of the reviewers are wrong. In my opinion, this movie is not about tolerance or diversity; it's about individuals' emotional understandings of the world.
__label__2 Great Frame: I bought this frame for my wife for Christmas. It's worked great since then. The picture transfer software is a little slow but we only use it every once in while anyway. I would definately buy this frame again. We love it because we have a way to look at all of our digital pictures that we told ourselves we were going to print out. Now we can look at our pictures every day instead of digging into a folder on my hard drive every once in a while.
__label__2 A gentle delight: This book is beautifully illustrated, and is a very gentle, loving look at relationships and being true to yourself.
__label__2 Tried it out of desperation...: ...after my favorite shave soap was discontinued, but became a fan after test-driving it for a few shaves; nice lather, easy on the skin, pleasant fragrance.
__label__2 great product and fast shipper: I had been on a very strict diet - hence some hair loss. These vitamins gave my body the extra help it needed to regain the growth and keep it. The seller ships very fast!!! I have been very impressed with both the product and the seller. I have reordered several times and will continue to do so.
__label__1 Not for anyone wanting to LEARN piano: I do not recommend this book. It is a spiral bound book of photocopies and includes a page of number stickers. The "songs" in the book consist of numbers that only allow one to play the basic melody of a song. The book has nothing that would teach one to read music, play a rhythm, or know the piano notes. I purchased this for my daughter and immediately returned it. From someone who can play the piano and read music, I was hugely disappointed as I want my kids to actually learn the piano not just to play a song or two.
__label__1 Not recommended - sorry I bought it.: I have used it only a few times but this multimeter was a waste of money. Sometimes it works, and other times it acts like it works but the reading will be off the chart. It is extremely undependable, so I do not recommend it.
__label__1 Too Crazy!!: I put this dvd in an shut if off within less than 5 mins. I thought this would be a great workout because of all the positive reviews. I was shocked after the first couple seconds that this workout actually had as many great reviews as it does. I have worked out for 12 yrs. using dvds or videos. This is the 1st one I tossed in the trash. I like Amy...she's very nice. However, this is way too fast and crazy. No way to focus on getting a great workout due to the fact that you have to figure out every move they are doing on your own with no modificaton of any kind. It's so fast you can't concentrate. Sorry, but this was officailly the worst excercise dvd I have ever purchased. Thankful that I bought it used!!
__label__2 excellent but not all that my husband hoped: The gloves are indeed excellent in that the cuff is long enough to protect when working with the grill.But they are not insulated to grab hot items off the grill as hoped.
__label__1 Ok starter system: This is a great system out of the box and for those new to surround systems, but not for the advanced listener. This system is easy to install. That is all I can say about it. The listening effects are maddening. You are unable to control the treble or bass yourself and will have to rely on preset Sony programs and you will be left wanting more if you have more than a small living space. The sound strength is very weak, and yes, as previous posts stated, update the base as this system has none. More, the absolute worst part of this system is not only they length it takes to read a disk; you will have no idea if it you have selected a cd or dvd until it has finished reading the disk. Not worth my time. This is a great system for those who can not hook up a wired system; but for all others, save your money for something more meatier.
__label__2 bought it for harry potter stuff: So, I wrote to the bathroom reader's institue and asked if there was any books with Harry Potter info in it, and they referred me to this book that supposedly had two articles. The HP articles were just ok, but overall, the book was pretty cute.
__label__2 Delicious: Many other good reviews here. All I can add is this set is worth owning as much for the added opera choruses as it is the absolutely perfect performance of the Verdi Requiem. I have listened to Va, Pensiero frequently since purchasing this set, and it gives me goosebumps every single time. The engineering is in top form. You get great acoustics, but still can hear wonderful details in the performances. And of course, Shaw at the top of his game. The orchestra and chorus never sounded better. Highly recommend.
__label__1 piece-o-junk: Appears sturdy, and makes a nice click sound when cables are inserted. However the click is meaningless. The cable had to be stuck so far into the connector to make stereo contact it would not hold. I ended up with mono audio on my recording. If I ever use this again, I will wait for the clicks, then strongly tape the cables to the connector. I'm debating a return, but it's not amazon's fault and don't want them to incur the expense.
__label__1 BAD PRODUCT AT AN EXPENSIVE PRICE: We bought this train as a Christmas gift for our six year old. We completed the setup in less than 10 minutes per the instruction manual. The engine worked in reverse just once and there were huge electric sparks seen flying. This train cost $300 but the quality and construction appear to be of inferior quality. We could not even order a replacement as Amazon said the item was out of stock. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED witH the experience.
__label__2 Fun and Funky Stuff!: James Carter, once again, proves himself to be the most entertaining of jazz's new hotshots. This jazz fan--and I'm sure there are plenty more like myself out there--is tired of the lack of fun in today's music. Everyone seems to want to make jazz records that make you think, whether it be about technique, song form, or instrumentation. Well, I'm tired of that egg-head stuff. Thank you James, for making a lively recording that makes you want to get up and move. Surrounding himself with great musicians and spicing things up with just enough of that "out" style, this CD is a rocking blast of fresh air. I'm a big fan as a result. I hope the rest of the jazz illiterati listens and takes some notes on how the music can be entertaining and not simply an intellectual pursuit.
__label__2 Attractive and practical: Very pleased with this spoon rest. It's attractive enough to keep on my counter full-time, and it's big enough to hold even the largest spoons.
__label__2 Great for amateur fans...: This ia an overall good compilation of almost every star wars book, novel, movie, show, etc. It is very complete although the latest stuff is missing (but of course it was written before the new Star Wars Era). It has a couple of contradictions and confusions, but only hard core fans can actually recognize them. For the amateur it is a very good reference guide, and for the hard core fans it is just a great addition to the collection.
__label__2 Great information and available for FREE: This film has great information and is now available to view in its entirety at the future of food website.
__label__1 Didn't Last 6 Weeks: I hate to write this review because I once thought Netgear was a better-than-average network hardware manufacturer, but I have been completely disappointed with this router. I have had a home network for 5 years now and have used several routers. When I decided to add wireless I chose Netgear because I have had good Netgear hardware in the past. When I first installed the router I was surprised at how poor the range was. Now that it has quit working after 6 weeks, I feel that I should post a warning. I called Netgear's technical support and found out that they have put a number of obstacles in the path of anyone seeking warranty service. I have decide not to through the trouble of returning the router - I don't want another one. I am planning to replace it with a Motorola router.
__label__2 Climbing the social ladder, or breaking away from it: McInerney's latest novel propels us into the lives of two young men taking very divergent courses in life. One, a "yuppie wanna-be" social climber from a modest family. The other, a wealthy young man born with a platinum spoon in his mouth - but driven to the opposite edge of society. I'll leave it to the reader to decide why young Savage chose to embark on a seemingly "conventional" unconventional rebellion against the upper echelons of American society.The book is a good read, and McInerney develops his characters well, on a three-dimensional level. However, one seems not much to care for either of them as they travel down two very different roads.The ending is clean - and does justice to the sometimes rocky, turbulent voyage McInerney sends one on to get there.
__label__2 Good item: This item is made of good quality and is a perfect fit. This is just an overall great item !
__label__2 Great replacement: I ordered this replacement power cable after the one that came with my Garmin stopped working. This was also after I tried a couple different alternatives from local retailers with no luck. Fortunately this arrived in a timely manner and works great- so far. I don't use my Garmin daily but probably use it a few times each week.
__label__2 A detailed look at one of our greatest contemporary poets: While Leonard Cohen's music, writing, and intreaguing life are enough to satisfy any romantic, this book manages to give a clear and accurate depiction of Cohen's motivations, influences, and understanding of life. From his innovative novels to his influencial and engrossing music and poetry, Cohen's life is portrayed as a constant exploration into the soul and the true meaning of love, sacrifice, and isolation. However, it is impossible to convey the passion and emotion that Cohen transmits in albums such as "Death of a Lady's Man" and "Songs of Love and Hate." In only this aspect does "Various Positions: A Life of Leanord Cohen" fall short of possible expectations. But perhaps Cohen's emotion is something that prose writing simply cannot capture. Leonard Cohen's life is certainly something worth reading about.
__label__2 Rod has done a fine job.: I myself have never been a Rod Stewart fan, but have appreciated his persistence. I have to say, he has done a great job with his Songbook collection, and full marks to the musicians and orchestra - they are magnificent. The arrangements of these great songs work extremely well. A superb CD to have on whilst relaxing and taking it easy.Cheers Rod.
__label__2 Satisfingly dark urban fantasy: I read this book for the first time shortly after reading Tithe. I remember I was surprised to find out that it doesn't focus on Kaye and Roiben, although they do make an appearance. However, I don't think the book is lacking because of it. Val is another teen with a dysfunctional past that comes to be mixed up in things she doesn't understand, falling into the world of Faerie. The concept of Never is a very intriguing one, and I like that its use does have consequences for the characters by the end. I loved Ravus's character. I never really thought I would be rooting for a troll as a romantic interest, but there you have it. If you read and liked Tithe, or you'd like to read a dark fantasy novel with themes of faeries, magic, betrayal and consequences, I'd recommend it!
__label__2 Highly recommended: I agree that the video doesn't provide any real information about the benefits of yoga for menopausal symptoms. However, I did find the video a very accessable introduction to yoga and Susan Winter Ward to be a very soothing, easy instructor to follow. I liked the video enough to continue using it regularly (I've never stuck with any other yoga tape I've tried) and to purchase another of her "Young at Heart" series. I alternate between the two and am looking to buy a third to vary the routine. Menopausal or not, if you're looking for a pleasant yoga tape I would highly recommend this one.
__label__1 Huh?: Fans of Evangelion? So was I until I watchEd this movie. Shinji is the most annoying character ever. He is all the most trivial problems of puberty lumped into one annoying whiny little jerk. Shinji is "afraid to shower in gym class" timeS a million. If you like those Animes that have long pointless and confusing endings, then this is for you. I guess Human Insturmentality is really code for "bore me to death with the pointless psycho-analysis of a shivering turd". And besides that, all I have to say about this movie is: What is going on? Seriously, I have no idea what happened except that I used to like this series and now I'm ever so angry.
__label__2 I use this all the time: I really like this product, although it does have its limitations. Recently I hurt my back (muscular) and I'm sure it helped on some level, but I needed something stronger for the pain. I've found it doesn't work on sinuses, but what it does work on is fevers and headaches, which I think is huge for a natural product.
__label__2 Not for the beginner: This book is not for the beginner. The reader needs a classical undergraduate education to follow this author's many references. However, you'll find the author thoroughly biblical and historically assimilated. A great read.
__label__2 I felt like I was on the crew: What a fascinating account of living on dogfood and seal blubber for a year. Nicely told and crisply written. Not a lot of imagination or creativity in the narrative. Bland but extremely interesting.
__label__1 Just not reliable enough for ongoing remote use: I've had the system installed for a little over a year now and have given up - it's just too flaky.Probably OK if you are at home and can unplug it every once in a while to force a reboot and re-association with the Z-wave devices, but just not robust enough if you are away for more than a week or two. What happens after a while is either a) the gateway doesn't respond or b) it no longer sees the devices. It would probably help if one could reboot it remotely via the browser, but that isn't possible.When it works it works fine, but the web browser interface is too limiting and at any one time there is probably a 40-50% probability that remote control over the web will work.
__label__2 I loved it!!: As I get older I find it more and more difficult to find record albums that I like well enough to buy, but this is one. First of all, in my opinion "Uneasy Rider" is one of the funniest tunes I ever heard. This one is an old favorite of mine from my college days, and whenever I hear it it takes me back to the Summer of '73. In fact I thought it was THE funniest tune around until I heard Uneasy Rider '88. Absolutely hilarious, and not to be missed.I liked most of the other tunes on this album very much, and now that I've listened to the album several times, I like them all. That's rare.
__label__1 Shameful: Watch out for the warranty on this pillow. It is not built to last. After 4 years of use it has fallen apart and the company will not replace it without charging me $48.95 and shipping costs. I sent them pictures and a reciept as they asked of me (frankly, I don't think the customer service manager at Therapeutica, Wendy, thought I would be able to produce them. Initially they didn't even return my first two calls. They seem to be pretty wiley. I wouldn't buy this pillow unless you plan on replacing it frequently to the tune of $70-$100. Lousy odds.
__label__1 Mr. Laine SERIOUSLY needs HELP!: My Suggestion DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS BOOK IF YOU DONT LIKE LIES and DISTORTED FICTIONAL MADE UP STORIES!Readers, i belong to the country of the topic of this book and let me tell you INDIA was never and is still not an Islamic nation in the 17-18th century and still today ........How could the tile of the book be such a BIG LIE!! blah blah....ISLAMIC INDIA!! WRONG Mr. Laine.........PLEASE CLEAR YOUR FACTS BEFORE YOU START EVEN WRITING A BOOK! Leave alone the contents of the book........becoz i pity your subject knowledge...Readers please refer to the following link for details to know about this fake book and its fake contents! The link explains the myths that the book tries to portray as facts.http://www.hvk.org/articles/0104/84.html
__label__2 New E.V.B. Standards: This is a great work. Every song grabs you with the hook and each cut is different. From the opening tributes to Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding through the jazzy blues of Jazzman and ending with the Leonard Cohen title track, this is Eric's crowning achievement. Do not miss this fabulous album from a legendary performer.
__label__1 Do not buy this. They will not replace it if chewed through: I have chewed through mine every 5-6 weeks and have sent it back time and time again and now they have refused to send me a new one. Even though I went through 5 it is only guranteed up to 90 days. So say you chewed through in March and sent it back and they gave you new one. You chew through it again and send it back. They will not continue to replace it if it is after the 90 day from your orginal receipt. I get 5 weeks with this mouthguard and it has to be replaced. They refused to replace it. It is poorly made if you spend $70 and it lasts 5 weeks. They also told me I was the only one who continually chewed through their mouthpiece. Then why does the return and exchange paperwork have reason to return "Chewed through"? Very poorly made and poor customer service. A product that only works for 5 weeks. 35 days and $70.
__label__2 disney movie: This takes me back to my childhood, great to be able to share this "oldie but goodie" movie with my grandsons.
__label__1 Constant insults and bad jokes obscure good info: This book does contain many helpful facts, but sadly the title is not just a one-off tease. The reader is constantly reminded that he is an oaf, and that probably the person who gave it to him thinks so. Well, me thag give bad review. To ladies who might think their partners might benefit from this book, the book assumes and reads like you are an idiot who knows nothing about science, fixing things, cooking or modern living. So you'll be suggesting that your partner is a loser. Just don't get angry if he retaliates by saying you look fat.
__label__1 If you like The Beastie Boys . . .: OK, I am not a big Beastie Boys fan, and this album ("Greatest" Remixes) reminds me of their style - loud, brash, unmelodic, hardcore. I couldn't listen to two tracks in a row without popping out the CD. I would've given this CD only one star, but I realize that it might be suitable for some people who liked that "Insane in the Membrane" sound I thought we got rid of a few years ago. As a note, I do have and enjoy "The Norman Cook/Fatboy Collection" and "Live from the Big Beat Boutique." Both of those CDs have some variety. This one is just loud and brash all the way through.
__label__1 A disappointment: Based on the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was hoping it was a classic on the scale of Henry Roth's "Call It Sleep." But it was not. The story was bland, and the characters were flat. It was not well written. What a disappointment!
__label__1 so so bad: no, just no. the first movie was interesting with some fun parts, but far from the best movie. this, well this was just crap. no better way to describe it. the plot was sensless, the way the "rider" moved around and acted was stupid. I couldn't finish it. glad i only redboxed it.
__label__1 Never received this item: I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. It never showed up though. It's been 3 months now.
__label__1 never received or got the book!: I never received or got the book! Im new to this computer stuff & ordering online, so I dont know what my recourse is or how to get my money back or the book. Please help me. barb
__label__2 Answered most of my questions: Well worth the money. User friendly. Helped me figure out the measurements for the stevia I use "Sweetleaf"Great desserts for a diabetic.
__label__2 Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years: What can you say about ANY Lonesome Dove movie? All are just plain the best. The actors were different from the series but it was fairly easy to adjust to this fact. For anyone who loves this series, it is a must to own and enjoy.Amazon made it easy to find and purchase this item. The seller was both prompt and honest. I am one pleased customer.
__label__2 Be prepared to build new synapses...: ...but once they are there you will get it. Refreshing break from the cookie cutter modern rock we see now days. Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars only because you can see that this disc is experimental in some ways and with any disc that realy pushes new boundaries you are going to get some not so good but with these kind of discs the good is really good. Often the beauty in experimental discs is the contrast that makes the good really good. To me one of the best bands at contrast were the Melvins but that does not mean I am comparing De-Loused to the Melvins. I would more describe De-Loused as a modern Yes with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but De-loused is so much more. Highly recommended intelligent, rock and roll.
__label__2 You're in good hands ...: I bought this after reading the NYT book reviewer'spraise for it, and I've made several of the recipes.The hands down winner is the Wild Mushroom Fricassee,which is that rare combo, exotic seeming but easyto make.My only criticism so far would be the productionvalues -- it's not a visually appealing book.Otherwise, go for it.2002 12 31 Update: this continues to be a high favorite among my cook books. After dining at Rialto, my opinion of Adams has only risen. Really, buy it.
__label__2 Interesting music: Great lineup, great music, the Four Brothers play another day. Great swinging charts with great solos. I did not know that much about the Four Brothers until I got this album.
__label__1 "Jealous" version is a completely different fit than standard 514: I wear 514's all the time, and I liked the color combo on the "Jealous" wash. However, this model of the 514 is COMPLETELY different than standard 514's - it's significantly baggier throughout, and the legs almost have a flare to them. Mega-disappointed in this version of the 514, as I buy them for their slim and fitted vibe.
__label__2 A Masterpiece of quality rarely acheived these days.: Avantasia's "Metal Opera" is more than a musical experience. It is a medieval-themed theatrical spectacle that leaves the listener breathless and speechless, longing for more. It is a work of art of its own kind, with no basis for comparison in today's existence. Drums and percussion, acoustic and electric guitars, synthesizers and grand piano, strings and violins, over two quartets of singers - are all parts of this mesmerizing epic journey. From the choir vocals of "The Seven Angels", to the hard-hitting, devilish mood of "The Final Sacrifice", to the closing "Into The Unknown", it is something beautiful and truly unforgettable...
__label__1 Broke on day 1: I bought this product and it worked great for the first hour or so of use. After that it started skipping on a song and then it cut out the singers' voices all together. DON'T BUY THIS, ITS A PIECE OF JUNK!
__label__1 shoddy workmanship: unbelievably low-quality plastic, noisy (high-vibration) motor,no fm (dx/local) switch. anti-roll mechanism seems to work, however. save your money...
__label__2 The best thing to come out of J-ville: I went threw the majority of my "wonder years" listening to these guys. All the songs on the album are great and i reckomned that anyone that enjoys punk rock should pick this up right away.
__label__1 Full of misinformation: While it's not sensationalistic like some books, the author simply did not do enough research. He confuses Vodou with Santeria, and apparently doesn't realize that the Ibeji Temple in Atlanta is a new religious movement BASED ON Vodou and Santeria, not traditional American practice. There are much, much better books on Vodou and hoodoo out there. Read those.
__label__1 Bought elsewhere and I love it... cept it leaks.: I bought this at a local retailer and loved the measuring lid and the built in strainer. For me, the place this shaker leaks is not the measuring jigger lid, it's where the lid fits onto the main body. It never seems to leak much - only 6 - 10 drops, but it still seems counter-intuitive to me. A friend of mine has used it and not noticed these issues, so perhaps it's just me. I am, however, looking for an alternative.
__label__1 Never Recieved: I ordered this and 2 weeks later i was told it was not in stock. so i cant tell you how it is. wish i could though.
__label__1 Interesting Idea But...: As other reviewers have said, this is too bulky to use for trips to a single country unless you plan to use it as a surge protector, which this allegedly does and is why I bought it.My solution is to slip off the front part, with the plugs, and just take the back and whatever adapter I need. HOWEVER the American plug from my Sony eReader will NOT fit into the holes available, which makes this pretty useless.And, as another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't work with European outlets which require a ground. Off to look for other options...
__label__2 Useful Navigator: Eccellent product and very easy to use. My job requires freq travel and printing directions are not effective. With this new navigator, I am able to make better travel plan and less rush to go from point A to point B.
__label__2 Vampire: The Masquerade-Redemption?: This is an excellent RPG. I played it for over 10 hours non-stop! It isn't a simple or easy game to win, which makes it more interesting to play. (I don't know how many times I got beat on each level before figuring a stategy that worked, but it was a lot! But don't let this discourage you!) I just don't understand why it's called "Redemption." (I never became Human again.) Also there is an area I could not gain access to. There is a locked door called "The Bowels of Vukodlock's Lair." I could never figure out how to unlock this door. (Maybe that's why I was never redeemed.) Excellent Graphics, Action, Etc. A Very good game!
__label__2 GOOD MOVIE, GREAT AMAZON SERVICE: As always, Amazon did a great job delivering this DVD. It arrived on time and in good shape. I've never had a problem with Amazon.The movie is a bit old and clunky now, but it's still fun to watch and a good companion piece to T2, the sequel.It's funny to see our governator all dressed up and playing a cyborg.
__label__2 Guide to Repairing Woodwinds - Saska: An excellent book for a beginning repair person. Similar info to the Erick Brand text. Includes a few newer methods, especially in the crack repair section. A worthwhile addition to your repair library, or a good first text that is relatively comprehensive.
__label__2 spunki79: I bought this table for my 3 1/2 year old son, before I even had it assembled he was trying to roll his magnetic balls across the tabletop. I am excited to set up his toy trains. Very good quality, very easy assembly, with clear step by step instructions. There could easily be another pull out drawer on the opposite side, bummed it only has one drawer, always nice to have extra storage.
__label__2 This one's a keeper..: One of the songs on this cd was featured on the PBS program 'Case Histories'. Liked it, so identified the singer and CD (thanks to Amazon's search feature). The album certainly met my expectations.
__label__1 A lousy movie: Why anyone bothers to make a movie this bad is a mystery. "The Thirteenth Warrior" remains the best Beowulf movie to date, in my opinion. This one stinks. Save your money and time.
__label__2 great vamp movie: I would recommend this for vampire movie fans. it's one of those movies that gets better every minute.I also like the acting and music
__label__2 The thinking woman's Danielle Steele: This is drama with well drawn characters that I can relate to and care about. I especially enjoyed the main character's self growth. This rector's wife realizes that her life is a poor fit for herself and her youngest child, who still lives at home. The steps she takes to find meaning and make a better life for herself and her daughter were realistic and, because they were realistic, inspiring. I really connected with this book!
__label__1 Off the mark effort: This book reinforces the belief that most people should leave their private thoughts in their diaries. The author breaks no new ground here, except to show convincingly just how spiritually empty the New Spirituality is. Her musings on abortion, men, and Christians are particularly off base and misinformed. She consistently illustrates intellectually flawed 60's/70's liberal reasoning--dream up an opinion based on your feelings, then hunt desperately for some kind of proof to back it up. I was looking for Erma Bombeck with a 90's edge, but all I got was juvenile self-absorption. Very disappointing, lacking in true depth, and not very funny. This book was returned in disgust. Save yourself the trouble and don't bother buying it.
__label__2 Fast Easy Reading: I'm not much of a reader, so you must imagine how scared I was when I saw the size of the book. I started reading and I could not put this book down. I read it in less than a day and when I finished I couldn't stop thinking about the book and its great ending.It's about a woman named Emma that goes on a business trip to Glasgow and on her way back she meets a man on the airplane to whom she tells all her secrets to when there's a lot of turbulence on the plane and she believes he'll be the last person she'll ever see. She thinks that she'll never see this man again, luckily, but to her surprise it turns out to be her boss.I laughed out loud and I felt her anxiety when she was nervous. The book has great imagery and I can assure you won't be wasting your time reading it.
__label__1 Potentially good, beginning was very interesting.: This was a potentially good book with a gripping beginning. Unfortunately, I chose to stop reading it because of the way-too-often-used "f-word." I know sometimes there is no other way, and to hear it once or twice would not have impeded my reading. But it was simply used way too often in the first few chapters for me. It's too bad; I think I would've enjoyed it.
__label__1 poor quality and service: This sleeve is the poorest quality "leather" without fitting properly. Save your money. Pieces stick out and don't allow a sung fit. It costs too much to ship back so don't get caught.
__label__2 Great grip: I installed this on my S&W Model 581 357 magnum and am very happy with it. Very ergonomic and makes shooting very comfortable.
__label__1 piece of junk: don't waste your money. i bought it for my father who resides in a nursing home. aides tried it and i tried it. it's a toy
__label__2 Quad 4: The best reason to buy this phone is that it has all 4 GSM frequencies which makes it great for traveling as you're far more likely to be able to make a call in a foreign country with all 4. Also being a flip phone which ends the call when you close it you don't have the risk of forgetting to end the call in Europe and getting a really big bill. As to the hundreds of teenager features I haven't got a clue but it works better than my last phone.
__label__1 Microsoft Keyboard: This keyboard is a piece of junk!I have always used Microsoft keyboards before and have always been very pleased.The space bar is very stiff and my thumb hurts if I use the keyboard too often.Don't buy this keyboard if you like to type fast,
__label__1 Dead monitor after 6 month: I bought this monitor in December, 2004. Initially it works fine. But I noticed that the power can not be turned on sometimes. I tried several times, and it worked. Then about one month later, the monitor would never work again. There is no contact information on the product box neither on manual, I contacted the amazon and got a support phone number.TRG (aka Corian)Telephone: 1-703-533-8555However, when I called this number, the company is not the manufacturer and the lady who answered the phone said she got a lot of phone calls on the same issue that happened to me.Amazone did not even have a correct manufacture contact info!
__label__1 SAVE YOUR MONEY!!: This video was, without a doubt, the worst video I could possibly imagine for a young child. There was absolutely no creativity involved when filming this production. Don't let the title fool you...music plays in the background while you watch a slideshow of antique toys. These toys have to be at least 30 years old and are completely ineffective when it comes to capturing the attention of a small child. To be fair, I can only comment on the first 5 minutes of this dvd because I refused to watch it any longer. Save your money for some of the more educational (and entertaining) dvds. Your kids will appreciate it!
__label__2 A Fun and Stylish Flip Flop: I bought these flip flops for my husband. He received a pair from his son but they were a size too big. He enjoyed them still and wore the heck out of them. When I saw these at such a great price I had to get them for him! I bought the size that fits his foot better and he has thoroughly enjoyed them!
__label__2 Heal Me!: Todd is once again way ahead of his time......healing is the pre cursor to all that bad new age music that sucks these days.....Todd will heal your soul with this one. Buy this CD, kick back and enjoy!
__label__2 Absolutely necessary for working with sexual abuse victims.: This is a must read book for therapists & other practioners working with victims and perpetrators of sexual assault. The information methodically addresses how victims are traumatized and how perpetrators can work toward restitution for victims. Hindman presents a historical review of sexual assualt treatment and the system's response to victims, the effects upon victims and their families, and current findings for victim counseling.
__label__2 Refreshing: Steve Holy is a refreshing new sound with a mixture of retro and modern in his style. The "Blue Moon "album has a little something for everyone. His vocals are effortless, smooth, and powerful all at the same time. The song selections are all great. A few of the best cuts are:"Blue Moon"- The title cut, a beautiful, dreamy ballad."One Beat At A Time"- uptempo and very radio, Written by veterans Jamie O'Hara and James House"Cold Kisses" - A latin flavored tune with a mystical feel"Just A Kiss" - Strong tune with an Orbison styling. Steve Holy co-write with Kevin Bounds and Leslie Davis"If That's What You Want" - Another James House song with a blusey, grooving sound. Kind of Elvis."Someone's Out To Get Me" Another Steve Holy/ Kevin Bounds composition. A fun, mysterious feel."Good Morning Beautiful" - Steve's recent #1 smash radio hit.You will definitly enjoy listening to this album!
__label__2 BEST INXS CD SINCE KICK EXCELLENT TRACKS: JD WAS A GREAT FIT, GREAT ALBUM YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM, FIRST TIME AROUND LISTENING TO IT WITH MY WIFE, SHE SAID WOW THIS ALBUM IS GREAT AA+++++++++++++++++++++
__label__1 Surprisingly bad workmanship!: Having just received this as a gift from my stepdaughter for Father's Day (which I coordinated with my wife based on the other reviews here), I am especially disappointed at the horrific quality. The pieces are so poorly made that they are tilting, wobbly, and easily fall over on their own during play. Some of the pieces were cut haphazardly and the black King tilts like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It would be funny and a no-brainer to simply return if it weren't for the shock after the positive reviews. It makes me suspect that the other reviews are placed by people at the company who makes this item. Hate to say it, but this set is crap and absolutely NOT worth the money. And I think the reviews are quite possibly placed by shills, not actual customers. Junk, junk, junk.
__label__2 Excellent Resource: This book is a well written book which enhanced my prayer life substancially. It offers prayers based in The Word which are meaningful and life changing. I would never have thought of so many key areas to pray for my husband, but since reading the book, I can't imagine leaving one of them out. If you are ready to change your life through prayer, this is a book for you.
__label__1 Terrible!: This collection of five tapes (two shows per tape) was packaged attractively- but the tapes were in terrible shape. Two of the tapes were not viewable; "Noise" and visual static interfered. The best of the five was "washed out" - no contrast, very white. I'm extremely disappointed- enough so that I have second thoughts about buying ANY used tapes ever again.I've asked the seller to respond- to acknowledge this problem, and consider an exchange or refund. I've had absolutely no response.This marks the second time that items purchased through AMAZON have had problems.
__label__2 Don't leave home without it!: This travel journal is an excellent tool to capture vacation memories and relive them for a lifetime. The journal boasts brightly colored "topic" pages along with markers and stickers which allows the child's creativity to shine through in words and/or artwork. We've used this travel journal for three vacations and wouldn't leave home without it!
__label__1 Norton Never Again: I have been loyal to Norton for almost a decade. No more.Positive-NAV seems to be working ok (so 1 star)Negative-the abusive activation schemethe bundled trash programs (FIREWALL, etc.)(deserves minus stars and circular file)Firewall will 100% protect you from internet intrusion and infection, because it cuts you off from the internet. It is very user unfriendly, it doesn't provide adequate support (It cuts you off from the internet, the manual is useless and the ONLY source of help provided is an internet address!!!!!!!!!)An example of the stupid controls: Scan for threats, find five, programs recommended action DELETE, then gives a choice of ALLOW (the threat becomes permanent!?!) or skip (no action this time, spend another 2 hours and get the same stupid choice later)! I restored internet access after hours of tweaking, next time I had to do it all over again, BUT my previous tweaks wouldn't always work!!! Never will I buy Norton again!!!
__label__2 The reference in the field: Excellent, from the "business drivers" model to the details of process, content, IS analysis. One of the few business book that covers the topic from A to Z, with a great explanation of each letters.Don't get it wrong : it might be only 260 pages, but it "contains" more than many 800 pages business books
__label__1 C'mon...really?: Beatles/McCartney fans have been waiting years for a proper DVD release of Rockshow, and instead we get 8 bloody songs? The music videos should be a bonus feature for a Rockshow DVD, not the other way around. No one needs to see McCartney miming to his greatest (and not so greatest) hits, but 3 DVD's of the complete live shows that are excerpted in this collection would actually be something worth purchasing. But that's too logical, isn't it?Then again, when has McCartney ever been able to release JUST a live show, without tons of unnecessary "documentary" footage disrupting the music.
__label__2 VERY PLEASED WITH RESULTS: I love that i can listen to my music and be inspired with out head phones getting in my way :) i see other people have complained about the stride but i feel like the stride is perfect not to small and not to big but then again i am kinda short ( 5'5 ) . When i started using this machine i was at 135 i and a bit out of shape now i am at 125 and in great shape if you ask me and all it took was 30 mins on the elliptical every day i absolutely love it i can get the same work out that i do at the gym at my house great for snowy days when i do not feel like driving to the gym honestly i can not say enough about the Horizon Elliptical E 30 well worth the money spent
__label__2 Another good Oxo product: Looks good in the clamshell which doesn't detract from the bathroom look. It does its job very well and is an ample size without being too much
__label__1 No Good: This pencil sharpener just arrived today and it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed. It is going back. I have had other Xacto sharpeners that have held up . As a classroom teacher, a durable pencil sharpener is a must.
__label__1 Should have left well enough alone: You have to love classic Superman. We had been building up what an awesome superhero Superman is to our kids, but this was a movie night flop. In their words "He didn't even fight!" This movie was a melodramatic disaster and a disgrace to Superman movies.
__label__1 a long commercial for disneyland: this is just a video about the parks of Disneyland Resort. You can get this free if you order it through the actual Disney site, just ask for the vacation planning video or dvd to be sent to you, its free!!!! you dont even have to pay for the shipping and handling, Disney pays for the shipping! I love DISNEY!!!!! If this was a Disney product i would tell you to buy it, but its some random company trying to make a quick buck on Disney.
__label__1 Not As Good As It Looks: This software requires many "upgrades" at additional cost - to get it to function the way most people would want it to function. Spend more and get something that's ready to go out of the box.
__label__1 One disapointing camera: I've been testing several cameras for my work and so far this one is the worst performance to cost for video we've played with. To get a one star it would have to have failed install or been otherwise fatally flawed as it is it works but The quality of the image , lack of focus ability and the quality of image, repetition? Nah it's a camera and it's worth noting that it's primary function is no better than a $5 after rebate model. Given the $70 price point this thing is seriously disappointing.Sound's pretty good and unlike the MS vx3000 which has a great picture ( but lags the sound horribly) it works on systems other than XP/ Vista )It's a real shame since it's nicely designed , has a pretty good software bundle ( specially if IM is your main use). Given that most of the reviews online have the same image issues I'd find something better than Creative live
__label__1 Good Book, Terrible Paperback Binding: My advise is to stay away from this paperback edition. I purchased the book new through Amazon. The pages are improperly clipped and ragged on the edges and some of the pages are diagonal. The paper also appears to be the acid type or at least low quality.This is a poor excuse for a bound paperback Centennial edition of such a great author.
__label__1 Ron Weitz "Looser": Hi I am a loser and i think this game stinksP.S:i am the worst video game and sports player
__label__1 Kessinger Publishing: Buyer beware: Kessinger "Publishing" does not actually sell you a new printing of Treitschke's book. What you end up with is actually just a photocopy of an old edition (in this case, the 1914 Stokes printing). Unbelievably, it also includes page underlining and marginal notes, photocopied from a used and marked up version of the text. Apparently it was too difficult to find an unmarked text, or to white-out the markings when photocopying the text. If you want an unmarked version of this text, avoid the Kessinger version--you might as well buy a used copy of an actual printing rather than a photocopy of someone else's marked-up text. It is disingenuous, misleading, and possibly fraudulent for Kessinger to sell this as "new."
__label__2 Fabulous!: I love this stuff! My skin looks better than ever with probably less makeup than I've ever worn. It goes on just like moisturizer but looks like I have on foundation. Awesome!
__label__2 Great quality, greater value: Regarding my purchase of Mr. Bar-B-Q 5-Piece Oval Stainless Handle Tool SetI am most pleased with my new Bar-B-Que tool set. They are stainless steel and there is no wood on them to weather. They are of a goodly size for use on my grill. Each tool has an opening in the end of it which could be used to hang it, providing your grill has "hooks" small enough. My didn't, but I bought a bag of leather strip remnants and my grandson tied military knots into loops for the ends of the tools. I'm all set. The price couldn't be beat. I checked pretty much everywhere. They are perfect and I'm so glad I ordered them.
__label__2 The BFG: I like The BFG because it is funny.And it is very intresting.I like it very much.The thing I like thats funny.Is that the wispoper that is funny becausethey fart into th air.
__label__2 An Excellent Book for Any Parent: My wife and I purchased this book to study with our small group at church. We are the parents of two girls (6 and 3), and want to raise them with strong Christian values. Stormie does a great job mixing biblical and personal stories about praying for your children, and raising them to be good Christian people.I recommend this book to any and all parents.
__label__1 Good Cleaner, Poor Customer service: With a young child and 2 indoor/outdoor dogs, I was really looking forward to clean carpets - 3 weeks later, I finally had them. The dirty water suction kept shutting off; the first time I didn't notice until the whole living room was wet. Tried to call customer service - the toll free number only provides recordings. To get a human required a toll call. Took 3 phone calls and a total of 35 minutes on hold to get through to an operator. At one point I left my pager number and was paged back to the hold queue. When I finally got through, the problem was a known issue and the fix was simple. I was then able to clean my carpets. The cleaner worked well, but the experience with customer service really soured my view.
__label__2 the good, the bad & the ugly: Again a great soundtrack of Ennio Morricone, just for people who knows to taste great soundtrack scores, a must have!!
__label__2 "Hey this is a Compilation with Bobby Jones tunes (Who knew?: As you can see the description say's nothing of Bobby Jones music on this one, but it's there! I suppose if you're a fan of his, then your Double-Blessed! Otherwise #11 of the #16 songs are the "Mighty. Most of these have that great 70's groove they were into at the time,(I personally Love it!). So this is a great album, just didn't know bobby was on the bus. Enjoy!...(Scotty G. knows good music)!!!
__label__2 Wagner Steamer: Did a nice job. A little on the messy side but worked a lot faster than spraying water in the wallpaper and waiting for it to saturate.
__label__1 Lord of the Night Not my favorite Susan Wiggs book: She is my new favorite author. I have been reading the fire trilogy. Started out with the last one Firebrand. Could not put it down. Lord of the night is about a beautiful young girl who is a painter. She was living in a convent and has decided to become a courteson to pay for her painting. She meets a venecian chief of police. He is very stodgy, old, and manipulative. He is not my favorite male hero. Everytime you start to like him he does something stupid again! Hard to get into this book. The foreign words make the book hard to follow. I feel as though I am reading a foreign book at times. Maybe you will like it better.
__label__2 Used for Football: My son used these socks as part of his football uniform. He said they were comfortable and I was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week. The didn't run or snag like some other lighter weight socks.
__label__2 traveling mercies grabbed and didn't let go: I'm always looking for authors who can write so well that you can almost most taste the words. In this book I can taste the pain, and nuances in every passage. It is uplifting and courageous. Many of the lines sink deep in your soul and give you thought, about christianity and the spiritual journey you may be on. I plan on buying her other books.
__label__2 Wha??: Frankly haven't read the book all the way through yet, and Cassavetes is genuinely important---but to suggest in the sub-title that Cassavetes "invented" independent film is a bit like saying Edison invented light--and more than a little insulting to those pioneers who actually DID "invent" independent film: Maya Deren, Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Harry Smith, etc. (and before that, the mainstream renegades who did incredible work even within a very constrained studio system: Carl Dryer, Orson Welles, F.W. Murnau, Fritz Lang, Sergei Eisenstein, etc)Just sayin'...
__label__2 Pretty product, good cust svc, some assembly problems: Great price for aesthetics, size and amount of chairs. Easy enough to assemble if you have any experience with ikea. Came up short one required screw, called cuts svc and they promised to send a replacement, so that was highly positive. Aggravated that when putting together one of the chairs, had the wood split a little, makes the back of that chair look ugly. Otherwise, love the product, and hoping to get lots of use. Will update in a few months to report on durability.Fyi re: height- bought this for my 15 mos old, who is at 75th perc for height. The chairs are too tall for her to easily get on to, she has to sort of climb up. She can still at it and eat, play, etc. I think a somewhat shorter chair set would have been wiser for her age. But, I'm sure by the time she is 2 it will be perfect, and hopefully then she will get a few more years out of it.
__label__2 The language soared and so did my spirit.: I read the book before the hoopla and found it a rich reading experience- a full symphony, a multicourse meal. I had feelings not experienced since"Song of Myself' was asigned in lit class. I will now read it again for more layers of experience,and not for "difficulty."
__label__1 tdrum: This would be good instrumental music Terry Bozzio can't sing I bought it with high expectations very disapointed given the talent level of Terry and Billy Terry stick to playing drums your vocals [are bad]!
__label__2 Satisfied Customer: I am very pleased with the quality and performance of the drill. The variable speed trigger is sensitive when using at a very low speed, but with practice one quickly becomes adapt at this. I really like the 2 way level feature for maintaining straight drilling rather then just guessing.The case is a nice item for storing when not in use or for transporting to job site.
__label__2 Hardcore: Jack/Joe Bishop is a friend of my family. So when I saw he was in this movie I had to see it. My dad was 16 when Jack broke his neck and I use to watch him play this sport when I was about 8 or 9 years old back in the early 90s at Lake Worth High school. The documentary is hardcore. Murderball by Joe Soares, Keith Cavill, Mark Zupan, Joe Bishop, Andy Cohn.
__label__2 Super Hits From a Super Group: Great CD for the price....it's just missing one Super Hit from this Era...it's missing "UPS AND DOWNS" cann't figure out why ??????????
__label__2 Can't wait for her next novel!: Very entertaining; couldn't put it down. Came upon this after finishing the delightful Bridget Jones' Diary. How she combines comedy (albeit satire) with the harrowing situation in Africa without trivializing is particularly deft. Am I the only person that thought her villains - Oliver and Daniel in BJD were awfully similar?
__label__2 good reference book: shows all the practical kicks in taekwondo -- and doesn't waste the reader's time with fake "hollywood" kicks that you'd never use in a fight. Towards the end of the book the descriptions get sparser, but the pics are all clear and it's easy to follow. If you can find a copy it's worth getting, especially as a teaching tool.
__label__2 letmetellyouaboutthebeatlesplease!!!!!!!: some people who are nopt very smart do nbot know all about the beastles like i do and thopse people are probably boring people who wear suspenders and drink yoohoo and make fun of kids just because they are a little bit bigger than maybe they are supposed to be because they have trouble running and you shouldnt be mean to someone for being a bad runner!!!! anyways!!!! the beatles were five people who created rock and roll in the forties or something they played real boring rock and roll but it was differant back then because most rock and roll was so bad that it made people cover thwir ears and run away ands scream DONT PLAY THAT BAD ROCK AND ROLL HEAR!!!!! so it was a big deal when rinko andf his friends made this great band that played pretty ok music because in the 40s or whatever pretty ok music was the best music that you could get! if you buy this record yuo will get bored but its culture!!! my gampa told me so!!!!
__label__2 Expensive, But Worth It!: This version is the 2001 Warner Chappell version. It is worth purchasing to obtain the original 1983 version of one of the best songs of the 1980s: "Send Me An Angel." But the rest of the album is also quite good, but firmly entrenched in the 1980's synth-pop sound. This album also includes Real Life's follow-up single, "Catch Me I'm Falling." The title track is a great song, as well. Yes, it's pricey, but the sound quality is excellent and must be remastered because it sounds great! The only drawback is there are no liner notes or lyrics, just a CD cover insert.
__label__1 Oh my god! and this it's what people call music: This is the worst CD ever ok,i just want to cry, this woman is really beautiful but she can't sing at all. Everytime it's a decent song but whit her voice sounds really awful. THIS IS GARBAGE, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD, BUY GOOD MUSIC LIKE DIDO, CHRISTINA AGUILERA, MARIAH CAREY, TONI BRAXTON, ALICIA KEYS, BUT PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BRTINEY.
__label__1 awful: I ordered this book on 1/10/09 and was given a date range of 16 days for delivery. I should have received the book by 2/3/09. Not only did I not receive the book, the sender did not inform me as to why the book was not available or if it was available. I would not purchase a used book through this vendor again.
__label__2 Jill and Bethenny should return: Even though the Jill-Bethenny fight was staged by Jill for ratings, I think it's clear that the show was much wittier and fun with the comedic shenanigans of Jill Zarin and Bethenny Frankel. Getting rid of Zarin was probably one of the biggest mistakes Bravo could have made.
__label__2 Value for Money center speaker: I bought this to pair with my polk audio monitor 40 speakers. the sound is amazing for this price and highly recommended.
__label__1 Disappointed, for sure.: It's a good thing that this product is discontinued. Neutrogena was smart to replace it with something better-New Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-In-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment - 2 ozGet this instead! It smells much better, cheaper, and actually works!
__label__2 just like 90s alternative, freaking amazing dood: You could easily mistake this band for Our Lady Peace. Same voice, guitar riffs, and awesome choruses. And don't give me the whole thing about being authentic. Nothing is these days so just listen to what you like. I've enjoyed this album thoroughly with its emo-ish vocals like "a bullet in the head, the sweetest kiss." The lyrics aren't plain and repetitive, as someone else wrote on this page. Well maybe they are repetitive, but thats what catchy songs are suppose to be. No one wants to listen to a chorus only two times. If its a rocking chorus you want it to be repetitive. Am I wrong?
__label__1 Blade Roller is "just" ok?: Pearl Abrasive Blade Roller works great if you have plenty of surface to roll it on. It will keep the surface you are cutting from being scuffed or grooved but if you are trying to trim an edge, forget it. The wheels have to have a surface to roll on. The aluminum design is nice, it won't ever rust and it did fit the WORM DRIVE saw perfectly, I used a Skil 77 worm drive saw. I would not recommened this product becuse it is not versatile enough to use in ALL conditions.
__label__2 better than expected: The focus is on the spiritual aspect of love making. I'm 61 years old and grew up in a time of sexual repression. I'm working on learning that those feelings were barriers to experiencing the true beauty of physical closeness. This series shows the absolute beauty of surrender and trust with a committed partner.
__label__1 Very Bad book: This is a poorly written book, which is why it fell off of the best seller list. His writing is elementar. If the font wasn't so big, and it was spaced so big, it would only be about 30 pages long. I cannot recommend this book. If you want to read it just go to your local book store, buy a coffee and sit for about 30-45 mins a read it.
__label__2 Camille Paglia is the coolest lady alive: Art history is boring. Postmodernism is dense and defeatist. Feminists are unglamorous. Camille Paglia's M.I.T. lecture, transcribed in this FABULOUS book, is the most exciting several pages I or anyone else has ever read. Never before has any academic been so honest. Oscar Wilde once said that in being concise, one sacrifices accuracy. This sort of rough, concise prose is what Paglia takes straight from Pater and throws in your face. This book, like "Sexual Personae," draws vast conclusions from little more than Paglia's own erudition, and is often, well....WRONG, but it is nonetheless the best piece of academic work you'll ever read. She'll put everything into perspective for you, and so much more...
__label__2 One to share with a friend: I almost passed this one by. I love historical romance and I thought this might be too frivolous. Boy was I wrong! Ms. Wynn was able to tell a delightful tale about a female elf trying to seduce a human male to win a dare by her elfin brother. Well known for their beauty, this elfin maid embarks on this adventure, certain that she will win the man's heart, but unaware that she will lose her own. The characters are well developed(and surprisingly believable!) and the story line is very interesting, yet it is a quick-read just right for the holidays. What could have been a silly story is in fact a heartwarming tale full of humour, adventure and romance. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, entertaining tale.
__label__2 We want MORE!!: I agree with almost everything that Jeff Blehar wrote about in his review (see below). They could've added a lot more songs to this greatest hits album, such as "Out of Control" from BOY, "Two Hearts Beat As One" from WAR, "A Sort of Homecoming" from UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, "One Tree Hill" from JOSHUA TREE (probably my FAVORITE U2 song ever!), and "In God's Country" from JOSHUA TREE. Not a bad greatest hits album but could've been better.
__label__1 All Creatures Great and Small: All Creatures is a GREAT book but this one was not suitable for the child I wanted to read it. Thank you for allowing me to return it. Theo Woods
__label__1 Total Waste of Time: > Poor plot, empty dialogue, and 1-dimensional characters kept having the same conversation even using the same words.> Annoying & tiresome protagonist couldn't stop self-pitying which evoked not sympathy but only impatience after 2 discs.> Terrible performance - couldn't tell which person was talking because they were assigned the same voice characters.> Would have given no stars if I could.
__label__1 Escanaba in da Moonlight: As a lifetime resident of Michigan I had high hopes for this movie. I did enjoy the first half, but then the movie got too deep into mystical imagery. The acting was good, but the story went from earthy backwoods humor to mystical fantasy toward the end.
__label__2 pure nonsense: save this book for a day you need escape. A day you just want a good laugh. I love Christopher Moore for those kinds of days.
__label__1 JUNK: took the device out of the package to find the batteries were corroded so bad that the access swelled to the breaking point. cleaned it up and purchased new batteries but still dont work. a very bad product...........
__label__2 Give it a try.: Being a father of a large family, I have mutliple game systems. 2 xbox's, 2PS2's. The D-skins work on both PS2's and only 1 Xbox.They also work on all of my DVD players. The 1 Xbox they do not work on is the Oldest one. So, I suspect that they should work on the newer sustems and you my have trouble with the older ones.My first purchase of these I bought 3 packs. Used them up in a heart beat and plan to by many more. If you have kids, I highly recommed!
__label__2 Good book: This book was very helpful to me. I have a c corp and my accountant is not very helpful. This book really helped me clearup a lot of things that my accountant always thought was precious and hid from me for his job security. The book discussses the 1120 c corp tax form which I haven't found in anygeneral business book found in book stores. But it is a littlepricey.
__label__1 Outdated: I would not recomend this book for people using it as an extra study resource I found it completely useless.
__label__2 Royce is the next star out of 313: The much delayed album from Royce lives up fully to it's expectations. I got the original release back in December, but he's added a few tracks and made another cd. If you've heard the 'Slim Shady LP', you'll know Royce from "Bad Meets Evil", well Royce also won the Detroit freestyle competition. This cd is great, Royce hits on all cylinders. The best tracks are the 2nd single "Rock City" feat. Eminem, the 1st single "You Can't Touch Me", "My Friend", "Boom", "Who Am I" and the newest single "Mr. Baller" feat Clipse. Every track is hot, if your hesitant bout buying the Royce album...I'll vouch that he's the hottest solo artist this year.
__label__1 low quality plastic reel: The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all.
__label__1 This album could suck start a jet engine: I would rather listen to 80 minutes of feedback at full volume with headphones than catch a second of this from a passing car. This album is to music what Jeffrey Dahmer was to cuisine.
__label__2 THE BEST: This is the absolute best reading of the bible I have ever heard. I love it and all my elementary and pre-k children love it and are actually quiet in the car when we play it. I love playing it in the evenings too, it is so calming yet it is read w/ emotion that makes everyone pay attention. It is a great way to learn the KJV better also. The KJV is the original bible in English and it's nice to hear a bible read in it's first and most important text. This whole set comes in a great carrying case too, which makes it great for on the run and keeping the set safe.
__label__2 Great tights: These were just what I was looking for. I've had a hard time finding ivory-colored tights in stores. Nice quality, comfortable, accurate sizing.
__label__2 This is a magical and fantastical movie for young children: My children ages 3 and 4 enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The 4 year old is a boy and has been tackling the idea of big scary monsters for the past month. This movie helped him realize that big isn't always scary and that he and his sister could enjoy something together. It is a magical movie and I recommend it for young children everywhere.
__label__1 Won't work: We've had this product for a while and never could get it to work. We've placed numerous calls to Lego and were told it DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP, so went to a machine with Windows 98. Still doesn't work on Windows 98, now I need to mail back parts and get new parts. This has been a 3 week process of upgrades, changes, being told it won't work by various people, etc. ...The 'tech support' line that they provide doesn't provide live help unless you figure out how to get out of their menu system. Otherwise they provide recordings and then say 'goodbye'. It's frustrating listening to a child's recorded instructions over and over again, only to end up back where you started.
__label__1 Bad pacing, ok workout, supp. equipments not useful: Most of the moves go too quickly, does not give your muscles are full workout. If you want to remember the moves and work it on your own that's fine. But then again why don't you just buy a book and do it yourself?The "sculpting stick" which does not include with the video, is not particularly useful to the type of workout suggested. With or without do the same.Also, the three 12 mins workouts was too short to make the video worth its price. I'm sure there are plenty of workout videos out there with better pacing for a full workout on your muscles and longer selection recorded. For example, I tried Tamilee Webb's Abs, Arms and Legs of Steel, that is much better I think.
__label__1 just junk: this tool just sat on the shelf until yesterday when i started woodworking again. This tool is now just a pile of junk that I can not find paper for. If it was any bigger I would use it for an anchor. well dremel you have lost another customer. there are other companies that make your same tools or if not I will find another way to do the job. If I could have given it no stars I would have. Anyway I give dremel no stars.
__label__2 Best toy for Babies!: I bought this playmat for my daughter when she was 2 months old. She absolutely loved it. Of course she was too young to really play with it when we first got it but she enjoyed looking around at all the bright colors and listening to the music. The legs of the animals dangle low so when she started trying to grab things, she could reach them easily. She quickly learned to stick their feet into her mouth and she loved to pull the elephant down so it would vibrate. I think this was the best toy we bought!! We was definitely worth the money!!
__label__1 Furniture doesnt fit figures are to big: The dollhouse is nice, but the furniture doesnt fit, and the figure will not sit on the furniture and its very loud.
__label__1 Crichton should stick to medicine--zero stars: Crichton is a medical doctor, not a climate scientist, earth scientist, or chemist. For that matter, he's not a scientist at all, he's an M.D. Crichton is credential mongering by using his medical credentials to push his absurd right wing agenda about climate change. If you want climate information, visit some university web sites to learn what real scientists have to say about climate change. For every Crichton-type book filled with misinformation, there are thousands of peer-reviewed, scientific journal articles that indicate (with data) that global warming is very real. I suppose Crichton will take aim at the Theory of Natural Selection next.
__label__1 Astonica Foldable Canopy Not Sturdy: Damn thing broke after 2 weeks of use--aluminum parts easily broken.
__label__1 Low quality !: Although this laser pointer is cheap, it is certainly low quality. Only 5 MINUTES after the package was opened, it began to malfunction. I have to press the botton really hard, and on the left side instead of the center, to make it work. Also it is very light and feels more like plastic or aluminum than 'solid brass'. Haven't got a chance to test standard AAA battery compatibility yet, but this was pointed out in other reviews. Conclusion: NOT RECOMMENDED.
__label__2 Great sexy music: I discovered Grover Washington years ago and never go any where without his music. this album is so smooth and sexy. It has some classic songs and others not so familliar This is one of his best! Don't go to the beach without this music!!!!! .
__label__1 Only worked for a week: We bought this therm from a store here in the city, for a lot more then it is priced here. Used it about three times before the display went crazy and you could not read the numbers any more. Unfortunatly we threw away the packaging so in the garbage went the therm also.
__label__1 DIDN'T WORK FOR ME !: Followed the diet exactly, ate more food than I ever have before for 4 weeks, looked better, but weight remained the same...think the low carb diet does dehydrate you, which makes you appear slimmer. Also, serious concerns over cholesterol levels.
__label__1 Poorly Constructed and Came Apart After One Use!: What a waste! While this mop seemed like a good value, I quickly found this bar-b-que mop to be an inferior product. After one use, the mop head came out of the handle during cleanup! Even with several attempts the head kept falling out of the handle rendering it useless for any subsequent uses. This mop is not a good value at any price. This is clearly a defective product. I expected something sturdier and I am very disappointed with this purchase.
__label__2 BBQ a Baby could assemble/ and a Dream to Use: This is a Beautiful piece of equipment that is amazingly simple to assemble. Only a few components to assemble and only a few bolts that need to be tightened. Total assembly took only 1 hour. Cooking is also a snap and this Weber has really been fun to use.Bon Appetit
__label__1 Annoying: This cd is very very annoying. The singers shrill shrieks almost make my glasses shatter. The group just goes on and on about morbid dumb things. I think Evanescence should go back to playing at Bar Mitzvas.
__label__2 The best item available for these bikes: I am doing a hasty restoration (if there is such a thing) on an R75/5. The book covers a ton, but I was left wanting more clarity on the suspension section. The manual covered so many models, that there was some time spent trying to figure out if my model had a certain part. After I marked it all up, hilighting and adding notes, it was perfect.I gave it 4 stars, not because there wasn't enough info, but that I had to weed through it to get what I needed. I might like it better if it was sectioned more into specific models.More to come, as the restoration (slowly) progresses.
__label__2 Exceptional: Maggie's marriage is over, she's lost her job...so she leaves Ireland and heads to LA. A change of scenery might be just the ticket. But this city of constant sunlight and glitz is a true culture shock...unfortunately it's still not enough to make her get over her bad spell.Angels seems to be a bit of a romp at first, but as the story unfolds, Keyes gradually explains Maggie's pain is more than just a failed marriage and losing her job. A deeper, more profound story emerges. Keyes blends humor and depth with flawless ability in this exceptional story of love and loss.
__label__1 It's Not What I Thought: I read a lot of good reviews on this product, but it did not do it's intended work on my car. The suction was great, but I further dented my car trying to make this thing work. I wasted money on this product. Just go to a body shop and get your car fixed. This will not work IMHO.
__label__1 A Booklet--Not a Book: I liked the Power of Now, but this followup really need not be published, because there is nothing new here. If all the spaces between the paragraphs were taken out, then this booklet would be about 50 pages and the thoughts on those pages have all been said before. One of the most glaring mistakes is what Tolle has to say about nature. He says learn from nature on how to be still. Hahahha. Gee, nature is moving all the time. The universe is expanding, cells divide and mountatins move. To say that nature stands still and stillness speaks really says volumes about how naive Tolle is and why some of his stated beliefs are just flat out wrong. I think what really speaks is the high price of this book given its slim size. That says more than anything!
__label__1 Keep the cord !!!!: What a horrible waste of my hard earned dollars this product is !!! First up, the headphones constantly refuse to stay put, they keep sliding forwards down off the front of my head. Second up, the random bursts of loud static and clicks and pops render this system useless no matter what the sound source or transmitter orientation, a simple A/B comparison versus a corded headphone told me a Radio Shack 100ft extension cord and a good set of headphones outperforms this setup by far !!!! I guess the one good thing I could possibly say about the Sennheiser RS120 is that it's range is excellent, 300ft of the same [...] !!!!!
__label__2 TravelJohn-Disposable Urinal: My husband drives a semi & we go to some really remote areas of Texas. TravelJohns are a VERY important part of packing!Word of caution: the top line is correct when the urine has gel quality not when still liquid.Still a great item for anytime you may not have ready access to a restroom.
__label__2 Very versatile with a multitude of uses: I'm a DIYer and therefore can't speak to the longevity of using this heat gun in day to day work. For the projects that I have needed it for around the house I have found it invaluable. The range of temperature control is excellent and the accesories are very handy. I get the most use from the spreader tip. I always follow the advice listed by some other reviewers and allow the heat gun to run on the cool air setting until it is cool to the touch.
__label__2 perfect upgrade from 3 yr older Norelco: I was using an older Norelco model of this device and was happy with it except that now it was so old that it was acting up. This one works just as well and maybe better in some respects. For example, they have upgraded the vacuum and container so now even less hair falls out on the sink. I'm not sure what to do with the turbo though, don't see much use for it in my case. My box did not come with a cleaning brush which was a surprise and the packing is just incredibly hard to open up.
__label__1 Book Size...?: I was unhappy with this book not because it was the wrong one or came in poor condition. It was a new book and came in perfect condition and it did come in a timely manner, but the book itself is 3 inches by 3 inches! And nowhere during the ordering process did it say it was a pocket size book. I was upset that this information was not provided. I bought the book with the intention of reading it to my children, which I can't really do because it's not big enough for them to look at the pictures with me.
__label__2 Different from Season 1: Season 2 is different from season 1. Shaun the sheep was unique,because the characters didn't do violent things to each other, and weren't insulting...it was an obvious the writers/creators stuck to that format. In Season 2, they reverted to, well, being like every other Tom and Jerry cartoon. It's still very good stuff, but a little disappointing for the change.
__label__1 Get Smart: Nobody can belly up to the original...sad copy. Acting forced...plot lacked the original ingenuity. I'm sorry, but I don't think Steve Carell is funny...
__label__2 A Must Have Resource: This is a must have book for those who are advanced users of Excel. You do not have to be a programmer to appreciate the advice and instruction found between the pages of this reference book. Gaining an understanding of VBA can only expand your Excel skills. This tool can assist even the beginner with adding automation to their Workbooks. Even if you only write your macros to complete the mundane tasks and save time, this book is an excellent guide.Chris ...
__label__2 A great, scary, and exciting book: Skeleton Manis a scary book and a great book at the same time. Unlike most books, i couldn't put this book down! It got me scared at some points. Skelton Man is a great character. the author did an excellent job trying to make a modern type monster. Sometimes I would stare at the words on the page, other times I would give a sigh of relief. I loved the setting and reasons for the story. it really is a terrific book!!!~
__label__1 Little dipper is a true "crock": I have a "Little Dipper". Please be aware that you CANNOT cook with this--though that is only indicated in the instruction book. The cord for this cooker is too short for safety, making it virtually mandatory to use an extension cord. So much for safety. This is apparently designed for the narrow use of keeping dips warm. This might be acceptable, but the temperature is below the 140 degree level considered a minimum for safety by food service professionals. Also, you really have to heat the food separately and then put it in the pot--a real nuisance. The clincher is that it's a real pain to clean. Do not consider this Little Dipper a "bonus"! Instead, consider that it probably needs to be discarded.
__label__1 Bad Warrantee Service: I have always bought Panasonic or Technics So i bought this unit 6 months ago. It worked for 6 months then suddenly the unit would not recognize a previously played store bought DVD, nor would it eject it. Talked with support still not working. They said they were sending me a shipping label to have it sent in and fixed under warrantee. OK, at least I thought. A week later nothing in the mail. I call beck, they apologize and tell me they would mail me one and e-mail me one. Well days later no e-mail from them at all. I sent an e-mail asking about my case and the label. No answer.These are the facts...no opinion offered
__label__1 Sorry, Paul, not your best...: I LOVE Paul Giamatti, and I had high hopes for this movie, but, sorry...didn't make more than 30 minutes before I shut it off. This is one of those movies with an AWESOME premise that totally fails in delivery/execution, in my opinion.Look forward to seeing what Mr. Giamatti does next.
__label__1 So many people hate this album. That must mean something.: This is boring music and the lyrics are 80 percent filler. In fact, I hate this CD. It's pathetic. The songs are too long. They're boring. Take a look around at how many people despise this album. The rest are just idol worshippers trying desparately to find something to like about it. Bob could have released any rubbish and you idol worshippers would give it five stars.
__label__2 Wonderful accessory for baby's nursery!!!: I bought this rocker for my four month old granddaughter for Christmas. My daughter put her in it and she IMMEDIATELY started kicking her feet and grinning. I can't wait to watch this rocker progress as my granddaughter grows.Thanks, again, Fisher-Price for a FABULOUS baby item!!!
__label__2 It's a good collection: I'll start by saying I guess I own everything done by Del Amitri. I'm a long time fan and another one of those who just never understood why this band didn't have more success. The songwriting, vocals and innovative instrumentals make them one of the best bands to come out of the 90's but still not a lot of success.At any rate this album is a good starting place for a new Del Amitri listener. It includes many of my favorites and all of the songs that had any commercial success. I hope those who buy it will find it a good jumping off spot to pick up some of the other albums and give them a listen but if this is the only one they ever buy they sure won't be sorry.
__label__1 Save the box and the receipt: We bought this toy and found that it was too heavy, too complex, and would not hold a good pose. Also, web-shooting wrist adapter doesn't work well at all, and does not fit wrist. Save your money.
__label__1 pains: Not a good product, cause stomach pains? pharmaceutical companies and Wall Street makes no difference, just think of money
__label__2 Great: The book was like new and it went along with the instructor. The book also went along with the instructor
__label__2 Dead Symbolic: I picked up the first of these diaries some twelve years ago, probably because it was an easy way to read someone else's diary. I have never been the same since. I have had a long relationship it seems today, with a collection of characters so insane, bizarre and unique that they seem real to me. The other characters that Sue Townsend has created have also hooked me. Whether she is writing as herself, the oh-so-intellectual Mr. Mole, a young Margaret Thatcher, or a fly on the wall at Bukingham Palace, she manages and wonderfully.I often hear it whispered that the author is tiring of these characters and intends to retire. I hope that she never will...I also hope that a hundred years from now, Sue Townsend will be remembered for what she is; one of the most outspoken, daring, hilarious writers ever to come out of Britain, if not one of the most gifted the whole world.
__label__1 A little too 'Hitch-hiker's" for me: It's not a bad book, it's just...weird. It's so tongue-in-cheek that I spent the first 2/3 of the book trying to dig past that part to get to the actual story. Once you get the story figured out and get a sense of at least a couple of the main characters (there were tier-2 characters who I still had no clue who they were at the end of the book), it's ok. But it's just way too 'out there' for me. My first and probably last experience with this author. If you like stuff like the Hitchhiker's Guide then you'll probably like this, but it's just not my thing.
__label__1 I wish I could give this 0 stars: There is no excuse for violence against the innocent and those who cannot defend themselves. The ideas that the author proposes are criminal, they are wrong, and they have no place in our society.
__label__2 Everytime: I have a Tom Delogne Signature.. and every time i replace strings I use these. They sound great, last a long time, and rarely break (one broke out of 6 boxes) HIGHLY RECOMEND
__label__1 Poorly printed: We(and our son) like many Baby Einstein products, but this book is just too poorly printed to enjoy. The picture sections under the liftable flaps are so dark and murky that they are almost unrecognizable.
__label__2 Book emphasizing creatior's genius: This book gives real appreciation of the creaive genius of the creator. Must reading for anyone who has an appreciation for this.
__label__1 Horribly Disturbing: I'm all for a disturbing film, but this one just made me sick to watch. The savagery that was committed in this film and the lack of inspired and cheesy revenge made this just a complete rip off of last house on the left. At least last house was done with some taste, some depth to the characters. There was no merit to this movie, and the only reaosn I gave it 2 stars was becuase it did what it set out to do, which was disturb the viewer with violent images.
__label__2 SOA Rocks!!: Love SOA!!! Love no commercials. Was happy I was able to purchase as soon as I finished season 1-3 on netflix
__label__1 Yes we know....Donkey is black.: Yep, voice Eddie Murphy, and wha-la Donkey has every stereotypical black cliche in the book.Yo Yo, bling bling, I'm Donkey. Sup y'all.
__label__2 Why? Because you Are Anointed: This book is a spirit filled and biblically based book. It is for those who are wondering why good people suffer and the bad go unpunished. It is a must read.
__label__1 not at all waterproof: This wallet was not even slightly waterproof. I took it on a cruise and the second it went in the water it filled with water. Basically it was worthless.
__label__1 A lot of bad sectors and damaged pictures: I guess it was also the sellers fault but the card that I bought has a lot of bad sectors and ruined a lot of pictures. To my bigger misfortune I went to a once in a lifetime long trip throughout Asia-Japan, China, Malaysia and you can just imagine my sadness of the many preciuos photos which got completely destroyed and others being overlayed with two others photos.And after I unloaded most of the photos from the card it got worse and it started damaging 3-4 photos in a row.Be aware from which seller you are buying this product and test it well before using it in a long run.
__label__1 Will not sustain 24 hour operation.: I've gone through two of these, and each one of them has broke on me. The first one was on a timer, and that one broke and the second replacement one was on 24/7, and that one also broke.
__label__1 Better Left to Memory: If you remember this mini-series from 90/91 and are seeking to own a copy, know that you'll be getting a watered down version of what originally aired. The DVD version comes in at 130 minutes - while I don't remember the exact running time of the tv series, it was probably in the neighborhood of 270 minutes given that it aired on three nights.So as you can see, about 1/2 the footage was cut taking out significant character and plot development. The final product is an odd collection of edits not doing justice to either the true story or original version.If you're looking for some of Benicio Del Toro's earlier work, this foots the bill though certainly not in a manner it could have with the unedited version.All in all, a rather disappointing product from editing to special features (virtually none).
__label__1 Atonement: Could have been a good book but: The first 20% of the book (Kindle reader) was enjoyable: then the author decided that sex needed to be the focus of the story. It ruined it. Too bad. The story line was interesting. I liked the characters, but after sex became the story line it was ruined - sent it to kindle's storage room.
__label__2 Great blade/price: I managed to break a few teeth off the original blade, so was pleased that the replacement was inexpensive, and arrived quicky.
__label__1 Two stars because is NOT what is advertised: The Mozart Concerto on this disc put out by the shameless pirates at "Iron Needle" is the THIRD Concerto, not the FIFTH as described. I am sure I had mentioned that on an Amazon review before, but it vanished...
__label__2 Adapter for Monpod: I bought this for my Monpod, it works great, I need a 1/4" X 20 thread to 3/8" X 18 thread for my Bogen Manfatto ball head, just screw it on your Monpod and then screw you ball head on and you have a great way to hike and stablize you shot with what every cammera you choice. Great product made of Aluminum with rubber washer to hold in place without scratching your equiement, I recommend this to anyone that needs adapter.
__label__2 Gripping!: This book is the definition of disturbing....but it may bring "skinny" into a better perspective for you. The media should read this & then re-evaluate what kind of skinny is appropriate for women...
__label__2 Awesome knife: This is the perfect knife for slicing and dicing fruits and veggies. It is easy to keep sharp and has good balance. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Try Something Else: I was extremely disappointed in this product. I was so looking forward to getting into some fun exercise, but this was more annoying than anywhere near exercise. As others stated, the leg band kept falling down (and it's not because my thighs are skinny!), if I wasn't holding the controls perfectly, the exercise would stop and I would have to stand there for a long time until I figured it out. This happened over and over. The competitions are not challenging at all. Maybe, just maybe, this would work for someone who has NEVER worked out before. They might find it fun. But if you are looking for a workout that is challenging and enjoying, this is not for you. I wish I would have listened to the critical comments instead of the great ones. I learned a lesson! I would have saved myself time and money.
__label__2 An Amazing book of pictures: My thought of this book is WOW! Pictures of Hollis Woods was a very heartfelt story about a girl abandonded in the forest she was named after.The pictures are memories, which I think is a very clever way to write a book.This book was full of the adventure of an abitous girl, making you unable to put it down. I'd reconmend this book to anyone 8 years old and up.
__label__2 The Book worked perfect for the class!: I was a little nervous about buying it by seperate volumes, but it worked out perfectly and I was very happy with the transaction all together! The book is in very good condition. Thank you!
__label__2 Ol' memories...: My parents still have the vinyl copy of this album at home in Spain. It was the one Christmas album that would really get me in the mood, even with no snow outside. This is a classic, bouncy, sing-a-long set of songs with no long and dreary carols to be seen, perfect for young and old. I have trawled through endless shops here in Britain trying to find this album and I am so glad I have finally managed to find it! It means every Christmas I will be able to relive those cherished childhood memories! Definitely a must-have for your Xmas collection.
__label__1 iCarPlay Fail: I bought the Monster iCarPlay wireless FM Transmitter to replace an older model I'd bought about 4 years ago. Testing this equipment on a 10-day road trip was miserable as it was near impossible to find a station that had clear reception to the transmitter. If I'd known this, I'd have never bought this and relied on it to keep my iPod connected for this trip. Using it around town is a bit better but is still hard to find a clear station that will stay stable beyond a 10-mile radius. Also, this came with no instructions. It took a bit of frustration and multiple attempts to change the channel (from the three presets) before I could figure out how to move the channels up and down one-by-one. Buy something else if you're looking at this. As for me, I'll be looking at direct connections to my car stereo and just skip the FM transmitter altogether.
__label__1 Failed Attempt: Open Season appears to be a failed attempt at a lighter romantic tone. The herione is such a ditz she set my teeth on edge. This book is far from the quality of suspense/mystery/romance of her last two 5-star efforts.
__label__1 Doesn't fit: It wasn't one of those keyboard covers that completely fits around your keyboard where you can leave it on and type. I was looking for a keyboard cover that was like that. but the shipping was so expensive, it's not worth returning.
__label__2 * see essential tools for diggers: I can't believe I waited this long to obtain a copy of this monumental book! & buying a copy of this from anyone other than the author himself (who is mailing them signed & cheaper than anyone else) would be a crime. This book is a diggers dream! I can't begin to stress the detail that has gone into this book. It's amazing and unless you were one of the contributors to this book, prepare to be humbled. Peppered within the book are informative antidotes re: the thousands of releases it documents. Probably the highest complement I can leave is that I now bring this book with me when I go record hunting.A MUST HAVE +++
__label__2 Malcolm Arnold's 3d Symphony: Most of Malcolm Arnold's music was written during the Cold War. The tension of that period, which many have now forgotten, is captured in his work. It is as if "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" had been set to music in the 3d Symphony. This work first appeared on LP on the Everest label with Arnold conducting. Other versions of the work suffer from pace -- too fast. There is no better version available than the composer's own. Listeners unfamiliar with Arnold know him nevertheless: in the 1940s and 50s he frequently scored movies, among them "Breaking the Sound Barrier," "Bridge on the River Kwai," "Tunes of Glory," and "The Key." The superb brass work in his music reflects his own background: first trumpet for some of England's leading orchestras. His guitar concerto is an overlooked masterpiece. But anyone who wants to explore this remarkably versatile composer should begin with the 3d symphony conducted by the composer.
__label__1 Save your money you have to be a HUGE Doris Day fan to buy this!!: to start I am a very big fan of Doris Day for yeays. I had just bought the 6 DVD box set of her movies & loved that so I decided to buy this TV series. It is so awful words can't describe it. It's not because it's "dated" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dogs
__label__2 The Best Book I've Ever Read.....: I loved this book so much! The whole plot was interesting and there was never a boring moment! This book was so intriging I couldn't put it down! Definately on the top of my recommendation list! Great for people of all ages, especially teens.
__label__2 This book is cool Uh huh huh: This book is a must have for any Beavis and Butt-head lovers, not necessarily a hardcore but just a fan. Its fun, big, cheap and will be a great addition to any 90`s collection.
__label__1 Activation impossible!: I am really not sure if the appliance works or nor, since Earthlink says they are unable to activate any accounts at the present time, and have been unable to do so now for 2 weeks, today they told me to call back in another 5 days! Every time I call I get another story - so if I am ever able to actually use the device I will try to let you know.
__label__1 good idea, but...: This is a good idea in theory, however, it just didn't work for us. Our son took a pacifier with no problems, but he knew this was different and just didn't want to hang on to it. Even though taking a rectal temp is no joy in itself, it's the best way to get an acurate reading. It's all our doctor's office would really take.
__label__1 Not Happy!!: Supposed to be an anti fog scope, never fired the rifle with it on. Took the rifle from a warm car into the cold air turned the magnifier and heard a poof of air come out and instant fog!! What piece of garbage!!!!!!
__label__2 "Born to Wander" wander off?: Great collection of a much overlooked group. It leaves out one of Rare Earth's great songs however. If "Born to Wander" had been included, it would have been a solid no questions asked 5-star recording.
__label__1 pretty weak cd: Its probably the worst cd made by anyone in Wu-Tang.The intro is funny and thats about it.The only decent songs on this cd were ones odb did with other people and they weren't even that good.If you want some Wu-Tang flavor get the 1st Method Man alblum,Tical.Its a lot better.
__label__1 Read my lips: This is about M-O-N-E-Y.: Paul McCartney has made a post-Beatles of pandering to children, but this strategy ceased to work finally with "Driving Rain", which sold poorly. What to do? Go live and charge the highest prices for rock concerts in history, then milk those concerts further by releasing a live album. (How many live albums does this guy need in his catalog, any way?) In any case, the post-Beatles material is drivel, and the Beatles material is exploitive.
__label__1 Didn't Get Past First Episode: And, I can watch it "free" on cable. Really just unbelievable: Electricity, all kinds, go out world wide. I know in scifi you have to suspend some disbelief, but really how can this really happen-scientifically(even science fiction wise)????? Then when the electricity goes out, the whole government of the USA colapses, and the country divides up into smaller fifdomes. Do the writers realize that prior to the 1900s our government worked just fine for nearly 125 years without electricity!? Also, there where many functioning government in human history going all the way back to the egyptions? Not worth my time, and they'll probably cancel it without a resolution just like Terra Nova.
__label__2 ahead of their time!!: This cd as some have conceded in their reviews came at a wrong time for this band and therefore failed to catch the attention of the radio stations. This music is inspiring to listen to when driving..feeling melancholic or just feeling upbeat..it is music for ALL occasions. But the cd whilst you can before it is deleted..believe me you wont regret it ONE bit!!
__label__2 A good tool for naive handler.: I haven't burnt myself yet! The iron gets extremely hot very fast. Perhaps I'm just not handling it well - it makes gorgeous girls in my thin wavy hair, but they fall out pretty fast. Maybe I just need to stock up on hair products that will help keep the curl after this great curling iron creates them. It's lovely, light and fun to play with. Again - I can't believe I haven't burnt myself yet.
__label__1 Complete Piece of Junk: The steering handle that inserts into the rear of the car could not be inserted due to a molding problem. The left front wheel will not stay attached and keeps falling out. Do not buy this product. Had to throw away.
__label__2 Kneipp Herbal Bath - Spruce: Another lovely Kneipp bath product! This reminds me of the German pine bath oils from Bavaria that I used when I was little. The smell is truly invigorating, and like the other products in the line, you don't need too much to have a great bath. Kneipp has been around for almost 100 years, and they still have a great natural product.
__label__1 This Movie Is Awful: I think my title says it all. Even if you're just an average computer user the blatant ignorance of this movie will drive you insane.Apparently the director thought that hacking had something to do with drifting through expanses of crimson colored space decorated with calculus symbols.I don't know anything about a movie being good because its so awful. I only know this: This movie is crap. Its two hours of your life that you'll never get back.
__label__2 I LOVE THESE CLUBS!: This is one review I've been meaning to do for months now. I bought these clubs becauses I needed some wedges for my set. The pitching wedge just wasn't cutting it anymore. I'm a pretty new golfer so I don't get into the back spin and such, but for close range shots these clubs are amazing. I look forward to pulling these out of the bag, the weight feels great, they're durable, and at times I'm even able to pull off some spin. Purely accidental of course. I defintely don't take care of my clubs like I should, I launch them towards the golf cart at times so I can pick them up on the way back. And unfortunately I threw my 56 degree a little to hard and smacked the golf cart. I thought for sure it was ruined, but low and behold it survives all of the abuse I give it. GREAT BUY! If I break this set, I'll be buying another just like it.
__label__2 voice recorder: the voice recoder is a big help to me. i take it into my doctor office, so my wife can hear what the doctor said.
__label__2 Track Listing: 1. Bent2. All The Small Things3. American Pie4. Desert Rose5. Everything You Want6. You Sang To Me7. That's The Way It Is8. Smooth9. Be With You10. Then The Morning Comes11. I Knew I Loved You12. I Need To Know
__label__2 At Any Cost : How Al Gore Tried to Steal the Election: Want to know why Florida was so important in 2001. Want to know "Just the facts" as Joe Friday used to say, then read this book. Sammons states the facts, from a neutral view focusing on just how bad both Gore and Bush wanted to win. You have to make up your own mind as to who cheated.With the aftermath proving that Bush had the votes to win Florida this book is a winner.
__label__1 I have not received it: I don't understand what is going on with my order--I have not received it. I keep checking on it and the delivered date keeps changing. Please either send the book to me or refund my money
__label__2 Greenstreet and Lorre and a Chinese Goddess: This is one of the best Noir films of the bunch. Make no mistake about it, the plot is absolutely terrific and I don't know why they did not use the famous French poster for the cover. It is all about luck and ironic twists of fate. Funny in parts, sad in others, but very, very good!
__label__2 A fitting end...: I actually, am a HUGE fan of the .Hack manga series. When I found out that #3 was the final volume, I was a little depressed. (Just a little.) But, I decided to finish the series, and the first day I got the third book, I finished it. The conclusion was a good one, and really ended the series well. Personally, I wish it didn't have to end. Oh well.May the .Hack series rest in peace.
__label__2 All you need and easy to read: I first became acquainted with Melissa Kaplan through Loco for Lizards, a hilarious book about lizards' place in culture by Jim Cherry. She is interviewed in that book. Learning her personal story gave me a great deal of respect for her as a person and as a lizard expert. She knows her subject with absolutely through and through and writes in a way that easily and breezily conveys that knowledge. Highly recommended.
__label__1 PAST REVIEWS ARE RIGHT: I AM TIRED OF MGA COPYING MATTEL PRODUCTSTHE SONGS ARE GOOD BUT THE COPYING IS OUTTA CONTROLBASH THE COPYERS!!!
__label__1 bear and the dragon: What were you thinking, Tom Clancy? At 10028 pages this book is much too heavy for the "I only have time to read before I go to sleep crowd". My husband loves Clancys books, but holding THIS tome aggravated his carpal tunnel syndrome causing the book to fall on his face cutting off his respiration and might have resulted in unlawful book death had I not detected the lack of snoring. He refuses to pick the book up again, so we will have to make do with the audio version. My advice is to take S. Kings advice: If the book is too big---make it a serial---or, make it part one and part two--if the story is good, we will be there to buy the book. At this size, The Bear and the Dragon is too dangerous to read!
__label__1 Don't buying this product!: I only used the monitor 5 days... and monitor doesn't work everday [just some time]!
__label__1 If your looking for some unique artist interpretations...: Im a hugeee coldplay fan since the begining, and i've been watching for anything coldplay related, esp a dvd or trubute, when i listened to this cd, i was unimpressed. I was hoping for some unique artist interpretations of coldplay's songs. Coldplay's music is i admit hard to top, but artist renditions should be more creative, I wouldnt recommend this cd.
__label__1 did not like this product: does not hold 12 cans very well, the shape is awkward inside our fridge and the cans drop at an angle causing them to get stuck in the back
__label__2 Great for the transition from Calculus to higher math: This book was a great intro to formal mathematics, which I needed after my very informal Calculus AB class. It starts from very simple (basic proof techniques, set theory, and number theory) to more advanced topics in number theory. I didn't understand all of it, but it was a great book for learning the basics of formal math and proof writing.
__label__2 Let me play my Mandoline: I love this thing! I slice and dice so much more quickly and efficiently. The only thing that gets annoying is when the final chunk gets stuck in the blade. It's difficult to get the guard to hold on to the small piece that remains after the rest has been sliced. I've sliced lemons, cucumbers, onions, limes, radishes, carrots, and potatoes. The list of possibilities for slicing is endless. I tried slicing a red delicious apple and the device couldn't handle it, :(. The mandoline also has some problems slicing small carrots. Overall, this device is great and I use it all the time. It saves time in the kitchen and allows even cuts for vegetables and fruits.
__label__2 Great All-weather cover: Great all-weather cover for most smaller motorcycles. I enjoy the soft inner fleece lining as it doesn't damage the pain on my 848. Just make sure the cover doesn't sit on your hot pipes!
__label__2 Outstanding!! Mouthwatering and sensational garlic meals!: This is the best garlic cookbook ever!!!!!The recipes are very easy to folow and the meals are outstanding. There is also a story on how the author saves himself from a scorpion sting, by using garlic. I love this book. It also has a tid bits section that had great tips on how to never smell like garlic.I recommend this book to everyone. It is amazing!!!!!
__label__1 Wow never thought it would be like this!!!: This is one of the worst final fantasy games I have ever played. They should take out the special battle mode. I know its been on all of them but damb!!!
__label__1 PRODUCT RIP-OFF: I TRIED TO PLAY THE DVD ON THREE DIFFERENT VIDEO SYSTEMS AND THE RESULTS ON ALL THREE WERE THE SAME. THE VIDEO PORTION WAS DISTORTED AND SKIPPED FRAMES. THE AUDIO ALSO SKIPPED. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE.
__label__2 Great for child with ADHD: My husband and I got the Leapster for our 7 year old daughter and are very happy with it. She is a child who typically can't focus on any single toy for more than 2 or 3 minutes at a time. She has ADHD and normally jumps from one toy to the next. We have tried all types of toys...dolls, dress-up items, board games etc... Nothing has gotten her attention for long until now. For some reason this toy has grabbed her attention and gotten her to focus. She is understanding educational concepts that have been very hard for her to understand in school. These are the same skills that have left her in tears in the past. I am VERY impressed! This is a GREAT learning tool for our daughter and we highly reccomend it. The Leapster is well worth the money!
__label__2 Fantastic - easy to test all sorts of batteries: It was always a pain to test batteries with the wires on my volt meter so I decided to make it easy on myself and ordered this sweet tester - easy to use and tests all sorts of batteries.
__label__2 Almost as good as Piper: Unjustly underrated, ASOS is really the darker, sader side of Piper. It also has the best mix of all the Floyd's players and songwriters. Waters, Wright, and Mason keep up the great playing from Piper, and even the Floydian bandit Gilmour sounds alright(kinda like a mild verison of the superior Syd). As for Barrett, he comes through like the great madcap we all love. The slide playing on Remember a Day, "Manic" guitar on Corp. Clegg, oh...... And Jugband Blues is the great Floydian swing, you cry with a smile on your face. Unless, of course, your inhuman(like many Floyd "fans" seem to be) and are only happy when Dave Gilmour says: "Well, that was not professional at all." Oh, poor, beautiful Syd.....
__label__2 killing floor: Great book - loved the path it took and showed conclusions to each person and the why behind it. Jack Reacher is a nonosense person and who could fault that . He has charisma and makes you feel totally safe .... bring on the entire series !
__label__2 Helpful and encouraging: Righly claiming that most high school language teachers have scarred us for life by dragging us through the rudimentaries of grammar before we ever speak a foreign language, Farber encourages a different slant on language learning: Learn as a child does. Pick up grammar and vocabulary simultaneously and from multiple sources. Dive in and keep going and don't strive for immediate perfection (if you need it, in time it will come). He points to several wonderful tools to help us and how to use them. Great book to get you started.
__label__2 Quality Keyboard: Unlike many people, I just want a standard keyboard with good touch and a PS2 (not USB) plug. Although this model has some custom keys for email, brower activation, music, etc, I didn't bother with them. The keys are a standard layout except for the Home/End cluster which is vertical instead of horizontal. That places the Insert key where the Delete key usually is, but it hasn't been much of a problem. For the price, I think this is a good buy, and much better than other $15 keyboards.
__label__2 Perfect for my son's sensitive tummy.: We HAVE to use alimentum because my son has and intolerance to the milk protein casien. In fact I breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months and I had to eliminate dairy from my diet to avoid reactions in my son. So when we were looking for a formula alimentum was the one. Of course the negative is that it's so darn expensive but when it comes to a happy, healthy baby price comes second.
__label__2 The Ultimate DVD / Surround Sound System Demo Disk!: Thinking of laying down your had-earned cash on a home theater system? You've come to the right demo disk. If the salesfloor salesman puts this on a DVD-based surround sound system, you're in for a treat! This disk will surround you with great color, spectacular special effects, and an even soundtrack that really shows you what the speakers are capable of. When it all synergizes pleasingly, buy the system, and include this disk! Never intended as brain food, Starship Troopers is a fast-paced, bug-hunting, shoot-em-up, set in the distant future. One of the best sci-fi action flicks since Aliens, and a real must-have DVD for action flick enthusiasts.
__label__2 Great backpack!: My preschool-aged son loves his new backpack. He has to carry a blanket, small pillow, and a change of clothing to school each day. This backpack is big enough to fit all that, but it's not so big that my son can't handle it. It's holding up quite well, too. I would recommend this backpack.
__label__2 Strong: I have used a lot of ramps for my quad and muust say these take the prize. Not a bad price overall, and easy storage.
__label__1 very bad: well i got this excited to have a rubik's cube and what happens in the first five minutes it breaks. it is very bad it feels like its made out of card board i don't recommend this rubik's cube
__label__2 Great Product; Great Price: Lifetime has created a great mail order product at a very reasonable price. If you follow the directions (and it really does require two people to assemble; and you really should get over 350 pounds of play sand to anchor the base), you get a stable high quality product. The installation instructions are clear. My only problem was with a bent post that had to be replaced. I received the replacement post from Lifetime very quickly. This set is appropriate for moderate use. If you want to be able to hang from the rim, this is not the set for you. If you want to practice normal shooting, this set is perfect, though experienced players might prefer a larger backboard.
__label__1 dictionar englez-roman si roman-englez: I-mi car scuze ca va deranjez,eu nu stiu prea bine engleza si nu am nici bani pentru a-mi procura un dictionar. Va rog sa-mi spuneti si mie de unde pot sa iau si eu un dictionar care sa-l pun pe calculator ? Va multumesc!
__label__1 useless and awful to wash: Don't every buy this product ,, there is no way to wash your hands with a regular soap or water. It was too sticky and there was no way to wash my hair "I washed my hair twice after I had it on my hair, I had to wash it because I didn't like it " they want you to buy the oil shamboo from them to wash your hair, but why you would buy the shampoo if the Dax it self useless"
__label__2 I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph: Iznogoud is the evil Grand Vizier to the good-natured but slow-witted Caliph of Baghdad Haroun al Plassid. Wanting desperately to be 'Caliph instead of the Caliph.' , he comes up continuously with plans to get rid of the incumbent , which always backfire on the miserable Iznogoud.Iznogoud's penchant for evil invention, together with the charming illustrations and witty dialogue makes for charming albums, by the same people who brought you Asterix.In fact in 'Asterix and the Magic Carpet' a reference is made to Iznogoud, as Asterix and friends is to battle against Watzisname, Iznogoud's evil cousin in India, in order to save the lovely Princess Orinjade.I was given a couple of these books, as a present when I was eight, and absolutely loved them.
__label__1 A little disappointed: I have saw him on TBN and youtube he was extremely funny. So when I saw that he had a dvd coming out I had to get it. But I was disappointed with this. I didnt laugh much and was assured that I would. But I will still support...
__label__2 Small, elegant watch; good for dress-up or dress-down.: Beautiful watch. The black face with crystal markers is a simple and elegant design. I really like the mesh strap with the adjustable clasp; provides for perfect fit around the wrist with no extra dangling piece like for leather straps. Overall, lightweight and versatile. I've worn it for work but also with jeans and black sweater. Skagen makes great quality watches!
__label__2 Medic Moist Pain Aid: I have used Raymac Pain Aid for about a year now and it is the quickest relief I have found for anything that is aching. Feet, legs and hands, it is wonderful for muscle pain also. Believe it or not my 12 year old dog has Arthuritis and I used it the other day when she could barely get up and down on her back hip and leg and the next day she was much, much better. I would recomend this to anyone and hope that they continue making this.
__label__2 Great value - wonky cord: This is my second pair of these headphones. The earbuds work great in my ears isolate the sound pretty well, and block the outside noise a little too well, not recommended if you need to stay alert to your surroundings, like biking or operating large equipment.The sound quality is good, but it will not going to compete with something in the +$100 range.Biggest (and only) real complaint is the cord tends to get really twisted and it exhibits memory of this twisting.
__label__1 SLIGHTLY SMALLER: These are slightly smaller than the #1 envelopes you will get from say, Uline.So, if you have a very tight fit, as I do - they won't work.
__label__1 Overrated.: Okay, so this band put out some songs that got a lot of radio airplay. Big deal - their music is largely boring and depressing. Except for 3 or 4 noteworthy songs, the rest can give you a headache and make you want to put your head through a wall. They seem obsessed with dark themes. For a more uplifting experience, check out Orchestral Manouevres In The Dark (OMD).
__label__2 Horror at a bargaib: While not a high budget production it still manages to deliver some chills to the viewer. Just get out the popcorn and a soda and set down on a stormy night and enoy an old fashioned thriller.
__label__1 one: is it okay it is not the best in the world.my name is deaven.not a lot of action.I sort of dint like it.
__label__1 Not the same taste or chocolate: I tried the new product but its not the same as when Ghiradelli made it. Very disappointed. They shouldn't bring a old time product back unless they can duplicate the exact taste/recipe.
__label__2 Great DVD considering...: ... this was taped back in the 1979 and even CD Technology hadn't been introduced to the consumer. Neither the concert nor sound footage are exceptional but let's face it - DVD's and big productions such as the recent Stones at Madison Square Garden were inconceivable at the time. The concert simply shows a young band evolving into something great performing music without all the glitz. Candy-O hadn't even been released yet which leaves a setlist of nothing but early material. Still, their earliest stuff was probably the most experimental and fun prior to technology taking over the 80's.The interview is extremely interesting. Many shared stories and some persistent chatter from a few members but still friendly with a bit of spook to it. It's obvious that Ben Orr's illness was no secret and it appears they all got together for one last yuckety yuck.
__label__1 Very disappointed: I thought this would be something akin to the roasted hazelnut pastes I'd bought before from chef supply companies. Nope. Supposedly this is made with roasted hazelnuts, but it doesn't taste like it. It really tastes more like it was made from raw hazelnuts. Also, it is very thick; the consistency is almost like that of toothpaste. Much of the oil has been drained from it, I think. To make it more paste-like you will need to add your own oil to it.Very expensive and very disappointing. I ended up throwing mine away.Its only redeeming quality is that it was rather smooth and not grainy/chunky much like another hazelnut butter I had bought online.
__label__1 "Get a grip" should get a grip!: Trash. I tried it on diffrent surfaces. it wont stay up for more than a few minutes. anyone who uses it for safety purposes is going to end up on a gurney. I am going to try to return it, if I can not I am going to destroy it before putting it in the trash. I dont want anyone getting ahold of it and getting hurt.
__label__1 Junk cable: This brand of very poory made.It failed after 9 months.Just after the 6 month warranty ended.Stay away this brand!It has potmetal mount that attachs to the firewall.The cable rub though intershielding and the pedal is stiff.
__label__2 Vital NYC Gallery guide!: Everything you ever wanted to know about New York City galleries, but were afraid to ask. There is no other book like this that I've seen. It's up-to-date, which is very important in the dynamic NYC art world, yet also easy-to-use - I found what I was looking for. Other artists, in NYC and elsewhere - it's essential.
__label__1 Stinky!: This balm claims to be chock-full of vitamins and nutrients and it sure as heck smells like that! Yuck! Have you ever opened a bottle of vitamin supplements and taken a whiff? Exactly as stinky as this balm is. (And not that semi-pleasant medicinal scent like menthol.) I was also thinking that this was a lip salve-ish product and since I peel and bite my lips, I thought this would smooth them out thus deterring me from my bad habit. In a word, no. My lips are still peeling and it stinks, literally, to apply this product. My advice? Stick to the cheapo over-the-counter brands!
__label__1 Too hard: I tried this out and then put into the "useless" box. The material from which it is made is just too hard. The shape just doesn't work.
__label__2 OneTouch Lancets: Excellent product. I use them at least 5 times. I did not feel any extra pain within the first 5 uses.
__label__2 Def worth the buy: This double set is worth it mainly only because it's a double set. Most of the KO's are from the old school SEG days of the UFC, before Dana White and the Fertita brothers even bought it. There are a few where the fighters don't even have gloves yet. While there is plenty of shock value in the brutality of it, I wouldn't even quantify it as real MMA. But its a two in one, so why not? definitely entertaining, but your mother probably won't appreciate it whether she's 40 or 80.
__label__1 Unexpected: I honestly expected something else when my mom brought home this soundtrack. The remake of the original 1974 movie was amazing and the music used in the movie was great. When my mother brought the soundtrack home instead of the classic rock used in the movie, it was all rap. Now I enjoy rap and the tracks layed down on the album are very good, but I don't think the CD should have been all rap, too many good AC/DC songs were used in the actual movie.
__label__2 A little funny: The book, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fiction story and it is a little boring. Someone has been stealing food from the farms and all the farmers joined together to get Mr. Fox and its family.I don't recommend this book because there are too many boring parts. Also there were many words that I did not understand. It has some interesting parts, but not enough to make the book a good one to read.
__label__1 Why bother: I found the book mildly interesting while I was reading it, but the end was a little disappointing and left me thinking why did I bother reading it.
__label__1 Misleading description: As thin as paper, flimsy, ill-fitting, and NOT 100% cotton as listing states. The size was way off, too. If you want a tee that's so thin it's practically see-through, this is the one for you. Better get several, though. I don't expect it to survive a wash.
__label__2 Plays Divx/Avi files!! Very cool: I was sooooo excited to find a dvd player that plays these pc only vid files at such a low price! And I am loving the Philips brand more and more each day. (compare their plasma TV picture to Sony's and you'll see why).The only complaint I have about this player is that it is a bit loud when spinning a dvd/disc. I have bought two and they both are just a bit too noisy. But still so worth the price and the ability to play Divx!! Love it!!!
__label__2 Thanks LB: The Listening, Sleepers, Chitlin Circuit 1.5, Connected and of course the hottest album out to date The Minstrel Show ...Finally, 5 real Hip Hop albums to keep in rotation on my 5 disc player...Thanks L.B.
__label__1 Awful Kindle formatting for code snippets!: UnlikeEffective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs (3rd Edition)this book is poorly formatted on Kindle (standard size). Code snippets are barely readable! The comments are put on the same line as code and because of line wrapping they are intermixed. This was somehow done right in the "Effective C++".
__label__1 Boring Pointless art film: This movie was just a long, boring art film.It was more of a series of scences and montages, as opposed to a plot and story.If your a film student, or like pretentious art films, then you will probably enjoy this one, its ripe with imagery you can descontruct, and compare to fritz lang.If you aren't a film student and just want to watch an entertaining movie, this isn't it, get oldboy or 3 extremes.
__label__2 Entertaining movie: Josh Brolin is very believable as a young Tommie Lee Jones; and there's a twist or two in here I didn't see coming. Very enjoyable. Will Smith is as entertaining as ever.
__label__1 not as good as I thought: I had a Canon S100 over 3 years and took thousands of photos. it was great. now its charger is broken, so I bought A85. the print color is somehow wrong. it is cold and whitened. the plastic body feels cheap. my S100 is better than A85 in print quality.now i switched to sony P100. it is very good. I want to stick with Cannon but A85 is really disappointing. The only good thing about A85 is that it uses cheap battery and memory card. But the prints are bad.my advise is that do not buy A85. buy Sony or Cannon's S series.
__label__2 A Great Place to Start...: I always get a little bit suspicious when a band with such a small back catalog comes out with a "best of" album...and after the slapped together money spinners that were "Kettle Whistle" and "Live and Rare" have already stung your pocket you have good reason to...13 of the 19 songs that appear on Ritual De Lo Habitual and Nothing Shocking combined turn up on "Up form the Catacombs", but this is not a bad thing - these two albums are where their genius lie...and make this album a great place to start for newer fans of the band.
__label__2 Cool Game: I bought this game because the Dallas Mavericks were doing good(2-0). This being my first basketball game, I thought it was as good, if not better than the real thing. The players have unique facial characteristics so everyone looks different. The gameplay is fast and it is challenging enough to be beatable but not too easy.
__label__2 Great Vacuum Cleaner!: I own a Siberian Husky and since he sheds profusely, I needed a lightweight but powerful vacuum cleaner for everyday use. I have tile floors with area rugs throughout the house. This vacuum cleaner is awesome, sucks up everything and is lightweight. The Power Paw attachment that comes with it is great to use on the furniture. I highly recommend this product!
__label__1 NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!: I have purchased a Navigon in March and my new navigation unit made by Navigon has already gone out. I am ok as long as it gets fixed. On the navigon box it says they will email you back from support.navigon.com within 48 hours. I sent my email out June 22nd and have resent it out 4 times already. Its now July 9th with no responces. I then went to Amazon.com, at first they said they wouldn't help me, now they put a claim in for me. So, I now have a 200 dollar navigation unit fron Navigon that wont work and no one to help me out, I am hoping Amazon I will still be back to where I was with no navigation unit for almost 2 months. I DON NOT RECCOMMENT A NAVIGON UNIT OF ANY!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no phone numbers for the company to talk to anyone, only emails of which they don't return emails!
__label__1 yea yea yea we've heard this before: We've heard it before. Can we say Britney Spears 3 years younger? I am the same age as Mandy, and I just can't believe she has had this much publicity...Most of the songs sound the same, and Mandy has NO range in her vocals. She sings all her songs in a VERY high soprano voice, and it almost hurts your ears. I swear. Mandy should stay in school rather than pursue this 'singing' career, cuz judging from her interviews, there's not much up there. She's just another pretty face. If you are in the mood to hear some young female talent, may I suggest Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson. Now those girls can sing, and they don't say 'like' and 'um' every other word.
__label__2 Great Dashboard Product - Does Not Slide: This product has great stability and does not slide even on sharp turns. It has a low center of gravity and works well. Just hide it away from view when parked to prevent anyone from knowing that you have a GPS.
__label__2 a beatiful novel: when i first saw these books i in love wiht them.i loved the first 2 books but this book truely touched me. it was a beatifully written book htat i would say was my favorite, it made me laugh and cry with the caracters. it shows how strong a bond between a horse and rider can be. i have a horse that i train and i truthfully believe in your methode of not punishing the horse. i would just like to conclude that these books are wonderfull and i believe anyone could learn to love the book
__label__1 A civil action: six pages missing, back cover bent, so frusterated threw out my book. Will not be back EVER ! Mr. Devan.
__label__1 Never worked for me: I ordered two. One never even lighted up when I plugged it in, the other lighted up but not one bug was zapped. Very dissapointed.
__label__1 A reader from South Dakota.: This book was pretty good because it had some action. It waskind of bad because some parts were boring. Like when Palmer andDorthy kissed each other. My favorite part was when Palmer was getting taken to Farquar. Beans, Mutto, and Henry took Palmer to Farpuar 2 times Palmer didn't like it either time. My least favorite part was when Palmer and Dorothy were in Palmer's room and Dorothy kissed him.
__label__1 Not even worth what you pay for: I got these speakers in late december, and by march 1st they were almost entirely useless. Even before they broke, the headphone jack for whatever reason had an insane amount of noise or scrambling. But for no reason at all, about 3 weeks ago one speaker started making lots of buzzing sounds and by the next day stopped working entirely. They had not been in any way damaged or mistreated and died on their own. Needless to say even for 20$ i would expect at least 6 months of use out of them. Dont bother spending you money.
__label__1 I lived it: I worked for a company where Putnam Texel was an OO process consultant just prior ro her writing this book. What a horror. We were getting all focused on producing these idiotic design artifacts but never actually were gaining any real understanding of the system we were trying to design. She was all process but never really conveyed the real methods of thinking that are essential to OO analysis and design. Don't even waste you time with this book.
__label__2 Rawlings, Welch Rule: Another triumph for David Rawlings, incomparable accompanist, ace guitarist, the clincher in Welch's success. Don't get me wrong - I'm a total fan of GW and pre-order every album as soon as its listed. But I *keep* playing it because I can't get enough of that Rawlings harmony and that Rawlings sound. One day, his name will be up there big on the marquee, too.
__label__2 love the series: ho-lee crap! this is the best series ever! i reapeat series because this is not the best of the series but is a very good book! it is good for middleschool and highschoolers!
__label__2 Northern Cardinal: As one expects from books in the Wild Bird Guide series, the volume on the Northern Cardinal is well written, easy to read, and packed with essential information and beautiful color photos. Gary Ritchison is also the author of another volume in the series on the Downy Woodpecker. As with that book, the text is somewhat more substantial than in other books in the series, most notably that on the Black-capped Chickadee. Overall, an excellent book, and I look forward to reading others in the series.
__label__2 Awesome!: This USB drive is awesome. I have had mine for about 2 weeks and could not be happier. I have no doubt that this is the smallest 2GB "thumb" drive on the market. It is extremely well built.I wear mine on my dog tag chain (I'm in the Army) and it's there when I need it.If you are looking for a compact drive with lots of space....this is it.
__label__1 worst: his worst book.. too,too many characters. after 150 pages, i still did not know who was who, i wont finish it!!! his only bad book.
__label__1 What A Waste Of Energy At A High Price Too!: I EXCERCISED MY ARMI purchased this video and used it three (3) times. First was to review it. Second was to use it. The Third Time - I got my excercise in the arms by throwing it out in the garbage. This video was produced poorly and the sound quality reverberates and it is irritating to where you cannot take this serious. It sounds like porno music. If you have seen the commercials you can hear the music in the background although it is faint. Borrow one from a friend first and you can judge for yourself. Working out with that music and the speech echos is just too much for me to bear. Sorry John Basedow but your performance was good but the video is just terrible. Try again.Mark Piergallini
__label__2 Awesome!!!: A beautiful box set! A good choice for any collector who would watched the series on TV. Nice image, sound, menu, extras etc. I'm not sure it's a remastered edition, but it's OK for me! I coudn't resist the low price offered by Amazon and got it right away. Now, I'll need a lot of spare time to watched all the 20 DVDs!!!
__label__1 This stuff is CRAP!: I wish I could give it less than a star!! I don't know what this stuff is but it doesn't work. Don't waste your money. I don't know how it could possibly work for anyone. I started having underarm odor in my late 20's. Nothing works, I've found a product called Dr Mist that is supposed to be guaranteed to work that I might try. I tried using this stuff for a week or so and if anything it made my odor WORSE! It went directly in the trash!
__label__2 Jazz Man on Johnnie Ray: You either like him or you don't. If you like him, this is a fine collection of his work and hyper style that made him a star and will cement the reason's why you did like him. For those who did'nt like him, this C.D. might change your mind, in particular "Whiskey & Gin"
__label__1 Poor design: I purchased the Troy-Bilt 4-Cycle 1.1 HP Gas Cultivator #144R because it was advertised to be a cultivator/edger. My power edger had just broke and I needed to replace it and I also needed cultivator. That was a mistake!The edger does not work as well as a standard edger. I later purchased an edger.The cultivator on the other hand works well. However the start cord does not retrieve/rewind without continuous help. The back wheels are attached rather loosely and make the cultivator hard to tow from job to job.
__label__1 Worst mailers I have ever had in my possession.: These mailers rip so easily. When removing the strip that covers the sticky adhesive, the entire closing flap rips off! I had to use packaging tape to seal the mailer. Not only that, I needed to use 2 bags just to make sure my product would be protected. I ordered these because they are waterproof, but that doesn't mean a thing if the bag is so thin that a finger poke puts a hole in the bag. I would not recommend these. One of the worst products I have ever purchased.
__label__1 Not a Low-Salt Cookbook: This is a low-fat cookbook with the words "low-fat" crossed out and "low-salt" written in in crayon. I need a low-sodium diet because of inner ear problems and I was very disappointed with this book. Consider, for example, these two recipes: "Chicken Enchiladas," p.112 and "Spinach Lasagna," p 142. The former has 684 mg sodium per 2-enchilada serving and the latter has 594 mg per serving. Sorry, folks, but this ain't "low-salt." The book does have many low-salt recipes, but the real focus is low-fat. The authors use considerably more space discussing low-fat issues than low-sodium issues and precious little of the latter. Since you're not going to eat enchiladas and lasagna every night (I hope not!), the average amount of sodium intake over, say, a week would be lower using these recipes. This is fine if your focus is to take good care of your heart, but if you're like me and you're sensitive to bursts of sodium into your system, this book doesn't cut it.
__label__1 damaged during shipping- poor replacement options: Bike arrived in a busted up box, missing pieces and damaged. Amazon offered several less than ideal replacement options.Who knows if the bike is any good. But I have noticed several other customers mentioning that the bikes arrived broken or bent, I just wanted to let you know that trying to get a replacement isnt easy and from the looks of things its going to takes us weeks to get a new bike. Hope its not snowin'.
__label__1 WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!: I wish I could give it 0 stars. Davis writes more about himself than the blues. The pronoun "I" is his favorite word. BORING. P.S. Only one mention of Johnny Winter....
__label__1 Doesn't work: I have the Midland 300 and thought this would make reception clearer. Wrong! It made it much worse. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 HE LOVES IT!!!!!!!!: I ordered this as a gift for my husband. He is a mechanic and goes to many of his customers homes to work on there vehicles if they can not make to him. This was a lifesaver for him!!!!!!!! Just enough amps so he can jump anyone's car....Clore Automotive JNC660 1700 Peak amp 12V Jump Starter
__label__1 piece of junk: amazon is great but this juicer is noisey,slow and i dont think it will last a year. big $100 MISTAKE.
__label__1 Good idea, poor design.: Yes, the Gold Finch's can hang upside down to feed but the vertical separation of the feed holes are to close together and this allows other birds to sit on a perch and reach the feed hole above it.I will soon be looking for a different upside down feeder as this one allows any small bird to sit on it and feed.
__label__1 NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!: I really disliked this product. First, once it was washed it shrunk and would not fit properly on the pad. I bought a standard contoured pad from Babies 'R Us and so it should have been compatible. Second, it's too much of a pain to keep taking it off, washing it and putting it back on. I have three of these and now don't use any. If your baby remotely spits up or goes to the bathroom while on the changing table (before you get a new diaper on) I've found it's easier to buy some nice inexpensive matching towels and lay them over the pad. They're cheaper and you don't have to worry about fit.
__label__1 Customer Support???: Installation nightmare!!!!This company has no customer support. It blocks your internet access. Shutting it off doesn't work; you have to uninstall it to get your internet access back. Then if the FAQ page that they have for customer service doesn't help (which it won't), the require that you fork over 19.99 for help!!! Stay away from this!!
__label__1 It is a Deceit: It is a deceit, nothing that to see with which it is offered, the functions are excluding and the very bad resolution
__label__1 Very superficial review of chest radiography.: This was a very superficial review of chest radiology. The pictures are not optimal for upper level residents and basically this is a good textbook for medical students and allied health professionals. Does have a very nice background introduction, but too much emphasis on chest radiography "signs." Would not recommend overall, especially to radiology residents or practing radiologists.
__label__2 So glad you had this book: This book contains beautiful pictures of all types of original carved wooden carousel horses. It is just a wonderful book to look at, much less read. I already knew what to expect, because I found this book at the library and had checked it out to see what it contained.You may want to do that also if you are considering buying this book.
__label__1 Weak, bland, blech... and I just started drinking coffee: Just started drinking coffee after 36 years and I feel so strongly about how uninteresting and weak this stuff is that I feel compelled to give my 2 cents.It seems even though I'm a newbie I like it strong and black. I like the Donut Shop. At work I like coffee that coats the teeth a bit. I know, gross.There's just nothing going on here. Little taste. Little aroma. If you make a small cup it's a bit better. In short, if you genuinely like black coffee that tastes like coffee don't get this.If you like it weak, or as others have said you just need a base for a fluffy drink (which is cool) then I guess this would work.
__label__2 More of a motivational book: I found this to be more of a motivational book than a technical book. I was expecting it to be more technical. In the end I can say that I appreciate the case studies provided by several of the author's acquaitances. It was a good read, just not what I expected it would be.
__label__1 There is no CD!: I bought this item a while ago from the book store, and was very happy with it, but I lost the cd, so I ordered this one, to have the cd again, and I was sent a softcover book with NO cd! I cannot believe that you would send me something that clearly states "Instructional cd included" when there is no cd included. Am I now expected to repackage this and send it back?
__label__2 Easy to install. Works great. Amazing way to extend the life of my ipod.: Easy to install. Works great. Amazing way to extend the life of my ipod.
__label__2 Brake service tool kit: Great kit. Universal and will work on most vehicles. Simple to use and a great deal.
__label__2 Commanding Heights: This is riveting history--it pulls you in from the first moments. The story of our world economy has never been explained so perfectly; Commanding Heights ties it all together in a beautifully done epic.
__label__1 This Film Insults My Intelligence: I was, no, I am deeply disappointed in this film. Who said that just because a movie is "made for TV" it is allowed to completely eliminate all acting skill, story line, and meaningful plot elements? This film is a hodgepodge of ideas taken from the story, trying desperately to cling together to form a plot. I have read The Tempest, it was good. I watched this movie, it was not. The only way that this movie could redeem itself would be if it were on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. It takes chutzpah to put your name on a film like this. Peter Fonda should run for president with nerves like that.
__label__1 Not even close to what I ordered: I wanted a paddle holster, the description even says, rubberized paddle, I got a belt holster, it doesn't even look like the one in the picture. The belt loops are too small for any belt I own so I can't even use it if I wanted to.
__label__1 It Crashed My Car: I was driving from Atlanta to Chicago when I was told by my GPS to take a right turn. So I did. I woke up in the New York, New York hospital where they told me I had hit a tree! Plus in the wreck, my GPS broke when it flew out the window! This is a waste of $2,000. You could get a good Garmin GPS for $200 and it wouldn't make you drive into trees!By the way, I ended up in New York, not Chicago.
__label__2 Another great Cantinflas movie!: Cantinflas is a professor in this movie. He is sent out faraway to a poor town that has no teacher for their students. When he arrives he comes to know the corrupt leaders who through out the movie try to make him leave. This movie is one of my favorite Cantinflas movies. Its a must have. Like in his other movies...he's funny, witty, and compassionate.
__label__2 I like the book: and it has a lot of great information just not always appropriate for my situtation but it is a good read!
__label__1 BLank Movie!: The Night Mare Before Christmas and James & The Giant peach is one of many favorites of our familes. After opening on christmas the kids were so excited, the next day we sat to watch our movies. Night Mare Before Christmas started of skipping but did play so they kids were happy. James and the Giant Peach will not play AT ALL!!! none of our dvd playes or neighbors dvd players can read the disk, one point dvd player said there was no disk inserted! Did we get a blank bootleg copy and were to belive we paid a hwat we thought decent price for these brand new! Not Happy at all. Have bought several movies of amazon with no problems and it only take that one time to make you go somewhere else and to pass the word!
__label__2 No one is qualified.......: ......to review Johann Sebastian Bach. In another review, I made a flippant remark about pretty redheads being proof of God's creative genius. That's true, but here's a quite serious opinion: God created Bach so He could delegate the writing of Heaven's music to a mortal man. I know what Bach sounds like here; what he sounds like Up Yonder, I can't begin to imagine.And then there's Virgil, the one and only...Call Virgil Fox what you will; showman, entertainer, Liberace of the pipe organ, the man knew how to make music. Yes, Virgil always put on a show. BUT, he NEVER let the show detract from great performance of great music.Professor Keith Johnson, and Reference Recordings meet their usual very high standard. This is a live recording, with plenty of audience noise, so be advised. Some fans like that; some don't. All in all, a wonderful, and highly recommended, recording.
__label__2 Great for Truffles and Caramels: Carole's book is good not only for great chocolates, truffles, and more, but also for confection such as homemade vanilla caramels -- a recipe which went over tremendously well in my household!
__label__2 GMRS limitations: Please note that GMRS radio transmission requires an FCC license by you, your immediate family, or direct blood relative, and may only be operated by an adult except in emergencies.The FRS frequencies do not require this; however, having both in one unit would be very tempting to use the GMRS frequencies. .... .Use of these radios outside of the US is very likely to be restricted or prohibited except in unregulated countries and may interfere with otherwise allocated frequencies of medical devices, or other radio devices.Note, these radios to not support repeater access codes.SUMMARY: If you are planning on being licensed and want the extra range of GMRS, these are great entry-level radios.
__label__1 An Ohio State Man is for an Ohio State Fan: Great little book for all Ohio State fans. Uniquely written by an Ohio State fan who befriended long time Ohio State assistant football coach Esco Sarkkinen. Full of great little stories and insights into Ohio State football that I have not read in other Ohio State books. Great stories about Ohio State legend Woody Hayes. Short book, well written, makes for a quick read. I would deffinately recommend.
__label__1 Worst Cat Who... book ever!!!!!: I've read the majority of The Cat Who... books over the years. This one was by far the worst. The dialog was corny. If I had a dollar for every exclamation point in the book, I would be a millionaire!!!!!
__label__2 Best most CREATIVE movie plus technology to date: I love the movie. Of course I still love life unlike many who criticize this movie because their minds are closed. Must be a lot of simple minded or stuck to the right so far they can't appreciate such a unique mixture of good story & cutting edge film technology.The movie itself is just super if you still have any inkling of imagination left in you. Only compliant is the HORRIBLE PACKAGING. I want to see the movie not waste my time fumbling with this crappy packaging. That sucks!I can't believe James Cameron got jilted at the awards by his x-wife's trash subject movie.GREAT MOVIE
__label__2 If you like anecdotes: this is more about the gathering of anecdotes from people he came across in his show business life and less about his own story. still, an interesting read.
__label__1 cheap but crappy: very weak transmission power, the sound is opaque and now it doesn't work with the power adapter, i want my money back!
__label__1 I ask. Who pays him to write books?: Dont buy the book if u want to learn programming in VB.NET. Find someother book.Do buy the book if you want to curse cry and see how fast you can drop OOP in VB.NetI know this is an advanced book, but come on is this for MIT PH.d's.?This book is book is basically structured like this:"You will do this and do that and all sorts of OO concepts"When in actuallity u will be typing hours of lines of code and in the end feel like u gained nothing from it.Please college professors lecturers CS, CIS, CE, IT, MIS DEPT directors please dont order this book. OR dont put ur students through this.
__label__1 If only these authors knew how to write: This book is essentially the combination of the movies "Outbreak" and "Seven" except you never sense the hysteria in "Outbreak" and never identify with villain as you do with Kevin Spacey in "Seven". These authors have the writing ability of 5th graders. The charcacters are completely underdeveloped. At times it seems if the writers have a thesaurus at their side judging by the use of overly complex and trite vocabulary. The authors also have a serious problem in the overuse of the excamation point. Unlike Sphere, which was a far better book than movie, The Eleventh Plague would make a far better movie than book.
__label__2 buy this book and get started brewing: everything you need to know to get started is right here. the tools and the ambition are up to you. the book is written in a very personal style and filled with lots of stories both personal and secondhand. recipies are great and simple. listen to this man's warnings he has a wealth of knowledge and experiences both good and bad. don't miss his whale photo on the first page.
__label__2 Excellent Read: After the cliff hanger ending of the second book, I had to hurry up and order this one to see how it ended. To me, Mr. Feist's writing has continued to improve. I felt like the first book - Magician - was a fairly obvious reworking of the Lord of the Rings. But his writing skills really come into their own, and make for a quite enjoyable reading experience.
__label__1 Vicious cycle: I've been operating on a diet of sex for some time now, so it's no surprise that I'm irritated by this author's claiming it as her own discovery. Am I obliged to credit this author for the many pounds I've shed since I began my substitution program?Also, I can't help feeling that the ones who really need help are the ones being left out. A sex diet is all very well for those attractive enough to get plenty of it, but how about those who struggle to find willing partners? How can the morbidly obese expect to get enough sex to take the place of their food intake? If anything, they would need MORE than the average person...
__label__2 Inspiring: This is a truly magnificent book that give great insight into the strategy and method of one of the most successfull leaders ever.It is very inspiring to read how Jack Welch has managed a company as big as GE with relatively simple means, and this should be an encouragement to all in senior management.Further the book is filled with good anecdotes and a humorous approach to nearly everything.
__label__2 Love this book: I used it with my daughter who is now 2 1/2. She slept through the night very early just like the book said she would. If you follow it's instructions and don't have a colic child or a child that has other health issues than i don't know how it wouldn't work for you. Several friends have used it and are very happy. I bought this book again when we had another child. My 2 1/2 year old daughter is still napping in the afternoon while I've heard other parents complain that their children will not. It takes discipline and commitment. Makes life happier and keeps you with a sane of mind.
__label__2 Great Movie!: still would like to know where he was all that time before he came to the White people, it was a sad story!
__label__1 In a better world maybe...: This book assumes you do not have a spouse who wants nothing other than to cut off your balls and take everything you've got and/or that she is willing to act with some degree of rationality. Well...guess what. That is simply not the case all the time. Maybe if I had the sense to start my divorce several years earlier, it would have been possible to utilize the very sensible advice in this book. Unfortunately, this advice was of no practical benefit in my situation and no amount of understanding or common sense on my part would have changed the situation.Good luck to anyone in this situation. I screwed myself in a number of ways by thinking my soon to be ex-spouse would react rationally and favorably if I only acted sensibly and fairly.
__label__2 Not bad...but Janet is still better!: Breakdown...Honey....My All...good songs, but Mariah get played out too fast! Yeah she can sing and sure she looks but she's turning into a lil' hoochie now! My girl Janet Jackson is still the Queen of Pop!
__label__2 Modern-Day Classic: I've been a longtime fan of King, and 'Salem's Lot is near the top my list of favorites. King is as lyrically descriptive in places as Anne Rice -- especially the park scene with Ben and Susan. This book illustrates King's masterful talent for taking the everyday and the possible and turning it upside down to show you the horror in everyday life. King will go down as one of the greatest writers of all time, and probably the single greatest writer of our era, because he describes society as it really is - and as it may have the potential to be. If you like Poe and Hawthorne but think King is pop/pulp fiction, read this book with new eyes.
__label__1 A personal diary of back-packing as novel.: Stephen Kear has put together, no doubt, his experiences of back-packing in every continent to give us the accurate adventures of Timothy. One expects a coherent novel but this is neither pastiche nor personal monologue. Kear is the person to write such a novel but what we get are vignettes and verbal cuttings from a scrap book. Anecdotes perhaps.The book may have been written over some time because the style and mood shifts restlessly rather than relevantly. The finest moment is in South Africa when the intrepid traveller gets picked up by a local and the dialogue is deeply insightful.But at the expense of plot.I bet he is mad that Garland wrote The Beach when he was sitting on it ten years earlier.
__label__2 Fantastic!: Questionable Remains is the first Beverly Connor book I have read and I am hooked! You instantly feel like you know Lindsey Chamberlain and are by her side during the whole book. I particularly enjoyed the events of the present with the past and how they parallel each other. The "marriage" of archaeology and mystery was excellent!
__label__2 Casablanca: Great movie. I believe this is one of the best movies of all time. It is very suspenceful and drama filled.
__label__2 Shadow's Word - Atmospheres: Crystal Waters: As with all of the other Atmospheres CDs I have heard, Atmospheres: Crystal Waters has the supurb backdrop of the sounds of nature. It provides excellent instrumentals that can relax your soul.This CD is truly a must have. I love it and it's a CD I cannot get enough of. If you are in search of relaxation, purchase this CD or any of the other CDs out of Atmosphere's wonderful collection.
__label__2 Philosophy girl!: I am a devoted philosophy user. This is a staple in my facial cleansing routine. Found it here at same price as philosophy.com but without having to pay shipping cost! It is a very pure cleanser that works great with a Clarisonic.
__label__2 The GCube (as some people call it).: The game cube has some good games and some games you can't understand the meaning of. It has some advantages, like the games Super Smash Bros. Melee and, Pik-Min. It has a lot of disadvantages, like not being able to play DVD's on it and the games like Grand Theft Auto 3 and Max Payne that PS2 and XBox have
__label__2 Works as Advertised: Had an old pair of rabbit ears which were only able to get one channel. Hooked up this antenna and now I can get all of the local over the air channels, many in HD. Product has worked great for me. Only critique is that when you extend the rabbit ears in back the antenna is not very stable and can easily be tipped over if something brushes up against it. Would suggest that they add a base to the antenna to provide more stability.
__label__2 Wonderful fall item: If you are like me you dread raking the leaves in piles and then bagging them. The problem is that you have to put all the leaves in bags before you quit or else! Last weekend I raked the leaves in piles but had to quit before I could get them all bagged. I pulled out Leaf Lock and sprinkled it on the piles. Kept them in place until I could get back to bagging them the following weekend. It is really a great fall item.
__label__2 Horray!: Always a treat to have Joan Armatrading singing. This album is fantastic. I have had it for 5 hours now!
__label__1 A Huge Disappointment: I really wanted to like this book, and I expected to like it, given that the author has strong literary credentials as the book reviewer for the New York Times. Unfortunately, the book was a huge disappointment.The idea for this book was that the author would take a season off from his job and his editor would finance an account of the 1979 baseball season from a fan's perspective. What resulted, however, was little more than the journal of a neurotic, and a not very interesting neurotic at that. The author continually mentions his shyness, and this gets boring after awhile. His inability to talk to ballplayers severely handicapped this effort.The author's first publisher bailed out toward the end of the season. Seven years later he found another publisher and the book got published, but it wasn't worth the effort.
__label__1 broad range of styles, photos need better color correcting: Lots of floor plans and cross sections. The photos contain a lot of information however the image/color quality is a bit off - some photos have a green tint to them, others are contrasty. For the price not bad - but better eye to detail would have been appreciated.
__label__1 Horrendous: This washer does a poor job of water control. The machine will constantly add water throughout the wash. It just wastes too much water in only 1 wash. For anyone who does not want a high water bill please stay away from this!!!! The only good thing about this product is that on the spin cycle this washer can get your clothes really dry compared to another washers. However, regardless Please stay away from this!
__label__1 damage control: Ill start out by saying this is a review of the movie not the soundtrack (the songs are actually ok) but in case you didn't know, highschool musicals are nothing like thisthere is no king a nd queen of the club, audtions are so different and students don't write the shows. Oh yeah, theres gays and straights and bis and anything else you could think of and everyones fine with it. Some people might think thats a vulgar thing to say on a kid's movie but hey, gays are a reality and drama clubs love jocks and other people joinging, the varsity football and basketball captain had a lead in Grease last year at my school and its not cause he sang like a pop star. If youre interested in school theatre talk to the people their open minded and we dont bite. Or read "How I Paid For College" a great book on the subject. DO not use this movie to make yourself feel like an insider or knowlegeable about this its not and i only hope the sequel will be better.
__label__2 Primeval psychology: Sometimes we run across a book that makes a real difference at the way we look at the world, or at least at an area of our own world. This is one of them. A poetic run through all the myths of the Greeks results in us looking for the answers to the same questions, thousands of years later. And of course to think about what is the core of human nature and how come it has not changed that much after all. The book is well written and the translation superb. The read takes time because we must stop to think, we must go back to read, we need to understand. Reading this book is truly a journey of the mind, a journey that we can at any time go back to by picking up the book later and opening it at any chapter. And for the more practically inclined, it is a beautiful romp through Greek mythology, with interesting connections to history and psychology. You can't miss with this one.
__label__1 FLASH Jetboild includes these.: BE AWARE !!!!*Note- This kit is included with the Zip, Flash, Sol Advanced Cooking System, and Sol Ti Premium Cooking System)$15 down the drain. In other words used for replacement ... :SALL IN ALL, Jetboil is great.!
__label__1 WILL NOT work on WindowsXP 64 bit: Did everything I could think of to make it work. Just not designed for WindowsXP 64 bit
__label__2 Great Research and Mind Blowing Information! 5 stars!: Wow, First off a man whom lived in the Library of Congress is gonna have access to all kinds of old and historical documents. Mullins whom is the last Living Protege of Ezra Pound really sets things straight. This is a Wonderfull Read that you can not put down and if you are an American Christian Living in this day I would say it is a Must Read! A Demonology of History Indeed! Its Very well Sourced throughout the book for any one fact checking and this really adds up. Cheers -KyleRayKeith
__label__2 AWESOME WORKOUT!: This is a great video and an awesome workout. I was sweating and my muscles were feeling the burn. Oreet is not only an incredible dancer but she is also a great teacher. She explains what you need to be doing and she breaks down the movements. She makes sure that you are in the correct position and that you are using the correct muscles. I take actual belly-dance classes from her and this video is pretty much like being in class. Its fun, easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it.Diana
__label__1 poor quality: I purchased 4 pair of these shoulder pads. They are extremely poor quality. Very flimsy. I wore one pair for 2 days and the bottom flap was so thin that it tore slightly on the first day and completely on the second wearing. I would not recommend them on the contrary.
__label__1 Roll the dice: This remote is very good in setting up multiple components - I had 13 that I needed to combine on one remote. The process and the software worked fine, it just took a little time to get everything together.But be very wary that these and some other lines of Harmony remotes come with a serious hardware flaw that Logitech refuses to recognize - after about 1-2 years, the LCD on the remote turns blank. The remote is still functional, but given the many features that are dependent on the LCD display, it's basically useless. If you call Harmony CSRs they'll give you a 50% off coupon for remotes on their web site, but that price basically mirrors what you can get online elsewhere. So you'll need to spend the full price again.So, if you're willing to gamble that your remote won't break - it's a good unit. Otherwise it's $120 every two years.
__label__2 Great Learning And Teaching Resource: Lots and lots of exercises and other really helpful information related to Aikido not only on the mat but also for daily life. This book is a great resource, not only now but also for future reference.
__label__2 Beautiful, enchanting: I was sckeptical about loving this movie, because I'm not a big chick-flick fan. But when I saw this movie, I just fell in love all over again. This movie will not make you cry, but it will make you laugh out loud and will move your heart. This movie now tops my list of best movies ever! Beautiful cinematography and music as well. Vive la France!! C'est belle!
__label__1 The book fails to live up to its title: This book is disappointing for someone looking for an objective discussion on Biblical verse and the environment. While I believe there is a Biblical basis for environmental stewardship, this book fails to make the case. Hopefully Van Dyke has done a better job in more recent writings.
__label__2 THE BEST!: I've been using this product for years!!! It is absolutley the best wax removal product you can buy!!! Worth every single penny!!!
__label__2 Excellent Modern Roots Reggae: You just can not go wrong with a Morgan Heritage album, especially this one. This album is an excellent representation of Morgan Heritage's range, versatility, and talent. If you love roots reggae with a hint of R&B; and a dash of Hip & Hop then this album is for you.As Reggae fans know, reggae is for all ears (if you just listen). This album is no exception. For example, my brother in-law from Bolivia visited me here in the states and he doesn't speak English nor has he ever heard reggae however, when he heard this CD in my car he absolutely fell in love and begged me for a copy of this CD.The grooves are great, the vocals are beautiful and the message is strong. I highly recommend this album!
__label__1 Remember You will get what you pay for: Poorly manufactured. The handle will not turn easily and every turn you will feel a bump. Overall the poor quality will remind you what you have paid. Don't get it if you are going to use them for years. If you are planning to make only one or two wood projects, it might serve the purpose.
__label__2 Interesting: The historical information presented by the book, even the last detail, is extremely accurate. It serves as a history lesson woven into a fascinating storyline. Although the book lacks a structured plot or even a clear struggle for the protagonist, Hannah Green, it follows her adventures and is definitely interesting.
__label__1 Not the flavor of Bazooka you remember: Obviously a recipe was changed. The original flavor you may remember from your childhood is no more. I bought a tub hoping for nostalgia...instead I got a so so gum. Bummer. If you are looking for the original flavor Bazooka, there is a supplier of Kosher Bazooka Gum. Jokes are in Hebrew...but it is delicious.
__label__2 The book is very suspenseful,all of the time!: The Westing Game book is a Very good book,better than most,justabout all! Greed takes all the heirs, I mean 200 million baby. Theresa bookie,a bomber, a theif, and a no-good killer! Most of the heirs are suprised to be related to Sam Westing though. And when they get paired, they dont like it! I wondered what pair of heirs will get the cash in a flash! I know, but if you haven't read it, read it and figure out, it will be fun! Ellen Raskin is good at mystories! I've seen the movie and read the book, both fun!
__label__2 Tivoli SongBook: I bought this radio for my daughter so she could play her MP3 player through it and it pretty much stays in her bathroom now. It sounds great but not quite as good as the Tivoli PAL which we got for my son a few years back. I wish it came with a rechargeable battery pack like the PAL. We are very impressed with Tivoli audio products and the SongBook certainly lives up to that standard.
__label__1 broken parts in 2 weeks: The light worked for 2 weeks. Last night, I found one the lamp was just hanging down. Looking closely, one of the tighten ring is already disintegrated.
__label__1 It is not a technical book but a indexing material: I think this book has no technical depth for home networking and it contains only the indexing information about technologies in home network. It has no conceptual foundation or guideline to build home network, and only gathers white papers or brochures of each vendors. I am regreting the purchase of this book.
__label__2 Great family movie, with more emphasis on the younger kids: The kids enjoyed it, and even we did. Certainly not the most believable premise, but if you can get past that, it's a great film. Definitely a typical "older" Disney film!
__label__1 not for the social: If you are looking for a book that offers a good guide to restaurants, bars, and the "amsterdam" nightlife this book is NOT for you. Even the daytime activities section in this was severely lacking detail (like renting bikes or picnicing in the park). In fairness to the book, it does offer a great deal of detail about the architecture and museums of amsterdam. So if that is all you are looking for then you will not be let down as I was...
__label__2 This is da' bomb !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I got this album before Amazon started to carry it. Totally awsome! The brightest spot is the works by Vangelis no doubt about it. All the classical piece are also very impressive. You need a good audio system to enjoy it.100% recommand to everybody who have ears.....
__label__2 my Conservative rabbi had all the teenagers he taught read this book growing up: While written by an Orthodox rabbi, this book is relevant to all Jews.The truth for Jews all over the world (even in Israel!) is, you or your children will be approached by missionaries, in the workplace, at college, at the park, on your doorstep. If you want to immunize yourselves and your children, you need to have intellectually honest and rigorous answers. This book really helps you do that.There is another book that I'd read alongside this volume to be more thorough and address more of the tactics currently used by missionaries. That's this bookTwenty-Six Reasons Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus. It's available through Amazon and at many Jewish bookstores.
__label__2 C2G/Cables to Go 40645 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2x RCA Female Adapter: I haven't used it yet. I tried it but in wouldn't fit into the jack on my speaker. I'll use it for something else. Thanks for fast delivery.
__label__1 Broke in an hour.: Within an hour of having it out of the box it stopped working. The wiring on the inside came undone and i won't be able to fix. Piece of junk.
__label__2 A lovely book that will teach you Lonning's art: This book is extremely well written, and if the reader carefully follows Ms. Lonning's instructions, which are accompanied by wonderful color photos, he or she can also produce lovely baskets like these. Some of Lonning's baskets sell for thousands of dollars and yet she generously explains how we can make them as well. In the book she also gives info on where to purchase the requisite materials. If you are unfamiliar with her exquisite baskets, her website, [...], has a gallery of her work along with their prices.Following her basket-making instructions are "bio-sketches" of 23 artists along with photos of their work. Some of the artists also detail how their baskets are constructed in case the reader also wants to try making them.I highly, highly recommend this wonderful book.
__label__1 Poor Upgrade: I have Create a Card Platinum 5 and really like it. I haven't upgraded for some time because I thought it was good as is. But I decided to buy the Platinum 8 to check it out. What a rip off. Hardly any upgrades at all in the format. A few new graphics, but what was available to me before is now only available on line. I felt taken buying this and think this company should be ashamed of themselves.
__label__2 Great CD: This is a very fine CD, but, in my opinion, the best CD they have is Chumps on Parade. I'm very proud to say that I come from the same city as these guys, good old St. Louis, MO. And yes, to understand the full meaning to "Hoosier Love," you have to be from here.
__label__1 Do NOT Buy this Book!: This book is the result of electronic scanning and optical character recognition of the original book by Samuel Deane. The book is THE authoritative text on the early history of Scituate, part of Plymouth Colony in the mid 1600's. Unfortunately, the combination of scanning and OCR has made the book almost useless for research. For example, the chapter titles are "1 Section 1", "2 Section 2", etc. The index is woefully incomplete: omitting (as far as I can tell) ALL references to the genealogy information which comprises 2/3 of the book (although, to be fair, the original text had an incomplete index.) DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. A PDF version of the original text is available online, and it is FREE, since the copyright has long expired.
__label__2 Decent for exam review: The E&E; series can be a little uneven. (The Civil Procedure book is better than most Civ Pro casebooks for actually learning Civ Pro; the Criminal Law book has some outright errors.)This one's better than average--not a substitute for doing your regular reading, but good for exam review. My only complaint is that many of the "examples" are real cases, so they don't test you much if you already did your other reading.
__label__1 Stupid! Not Recommended: We thought we would like this movie as the commericals looked interesting. For one thing there was way too much bad language and sexual situations with the bear. We should have realized, because it was made by the same people as American Dan and I can't stand that show. Guess I expected more in a movie and find it was even worse. NOT recommended.
__label__1 Bed mats ...poor quality.: I wouldn't recommend these, Poor quality for the money. I thought I was purchasing them from a seller I've used before but I was wrong. I would recommend JDCSupplies (SKU# ISG*30a5259) It's the same used in rehab hospitals and washes well. It cost $10. each but there worth it.
__label__2 wow!really great!: this single-cd is great. it's got her new single angels and an unreleased song called fly which is very nice. it also includes the video to angels. i love it!
__label__2 best seller: This book is userfriendly. I bought this in 1982. Still, I use this book when I need any information about unit operations of chemical engineering (fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer). Sometimes, I use this book like dictionary. I mean that I carry this book where I go
__label__1 BOOOORING: Ronnie James Dio is my favourite artist of all time. But this new work is so BORING!!! What happened? I don't know why people compare this with Holy Diver & Last in Line! HELLLLO???? Where can I find a song as strong as "Rainbow In The Dark", "Egypt", "Caught In The Middle", "Holy Diver"?? what we have here are boring rock n' roll songs. This lineup (exept Jimmy Bain) is old and tired. Simon (drummer) is inimaginative, the new guitar player doesn't know what a METAL riff is, he plays well, but lacks of enthousiasm. I can't find on this CD the energy of the first DIO albums. Well, I hope that Ronnie James Dio takes some time to think, listen and compare his first works with this one... It's heaven & hell....
__label__1 PRC Junk: I bought this elsewhere but I'll give my review here. First, this product is made in China, and I am tired of my money going to a Communist country. The product also simply does not do its job well. The rods are at a 40 degree angle to each other, which is a very fat angle, and probably the reason they don't sharpen well.
__label__2 An Extraordinary Woman, An Extraordinary Book: This is one of the most wonderful books I've ever read. Being only 23 years old the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby was before my time however, this story is timeless. Beautifully written complete with diary entries and family pictures. This book is a true literary classic to be enjoyed by every generation. An honest journey into the heart of a young girl, wife and mother.
__label__1 Sales Rank: LOW: The sales rank on 11-28-03 of 2,107 says it all: This album is abysmal at best.P. Diddy missed the mark with this group of wannabes who couldn't sing if P. Diddy possessed their bodies. I don't know why he'd consider this "group" talented, but he is obviously out of touch with reality.The only one in the band who stands a chance of reaching a star is Sara; but frankly, I don't think she has the drive and determination to enhance herself to the point where people would listen.Sorry ... from Dylan's fake Jamaican accent to Bab's horrible makeup, this band reeks.Don't waste your money on this one.
__label__2 15 MONTH OLD LOVES IT!!!: MY SON IS 15 MONTHS AND HE LOVES THIS THING!HE'S IN IT EVERYDAY, LOVES THE RADIO TOO!IT'S TE COOLEST TOY, IF YOU LIKE TO INDULGE YOUR CHILD!
__label__2 Downright Hilarious: You know those rare moments when you are reading a book and something strikes you as stunningly hilarious? From out of nowhere? And then you have to put down the book for awhile because you are secretly afraid you have just read the funniest thing you will ever read so what is the point of continuing to read anything again ever? Well this book is that book. And that phenomenon occurs several times throughout it. All hail John Hodgman and the h in sunrays!
__label__1 Very Disappointed.: I have a pit bull mix and until her I did not know a lot about the breed. I have been reading everything I can and talking to other bully parents. I have bought several dummy books and always loved them until now. In the first chapter on page 11 of the book I was reading it actually tells you how to fight pit bulls. Yes it's only a small section but it is very descriptive. I am so upset and will never buy another dummy book. As a pit owner I want people to like my girl not worry about her attacking them because Pits are used to fight.Very upset in OK.
__label__2 Does everything it says!: Not sure why all the low ratings from people, but I have nothing but good to say about the Innova 3130! I previously owned a Innova 3110, but wanted the "Live Data" reading to help track down sensor issues. This unit works like a charm! The unit also came with the carrying case, which my 3110 didn't have. You can't beat the features for the price!!!
__label__1 Boring: Was totally boring, didnt like it at all. it really just made me not want to read anything for awhile after.
__label__1 Anita, get dressed already.: A really weak book.Practically no plot and way too much sex.Believe me, I don't begrudge Anita her sex life with all the beautiful and supportive were-men. I was delighted when she overcame her prudery and hang-ups - how long can you whine about a cad that ditched you back in college, after all.This book, however, really overdoes it. First there are hundreds of pages of "we have to talk" scenes and endless discussion of everybody's sexual needs. Then there are hundreds of pages of sex. Towards the end there is (finally!!) a mention of bad guys and a brief visit to a crime scene that solves nothing.I really wish Anita would put on some clothes and go back to work.
__label__2 Need a good story?: This is a good story to read in front of the fire one night. I Kindled it but sometimes the price is worth not having a real book in my hands
__label__1 No, no, and no.: I've never read anything before where the author has the total opposite point-of-view about everything. I thought I could handle it. I thought it might be good to read what someone else was thinking. I was wrong, wrong, wrong. Everything Gilman is against, I am for. Everything I am for, she is against. I would just cringe every time she made some slam on anything conservative, anything Christian, anything moral. I had to stop reading about halfway through; I don't know how or why I even made it that far. If someone is insulting you, you should walk away. I wish it hadn't taken me that long to figure out I should "walk away" from this book. For all fellow conservative women, I would not recommend this book.
__label__1 Not as advertised: My Yamaha portable keyboard only came with 60 keys, not 61. The worst part about it is the missing key is right in the middle of the keyboard, making it virtually useless. I have contacted the seller (ANTOnline), but since they cannot be reached by phone it has been through email. Their online customer service department emails me back within 2 business days, but they will not replace it with a 61-Key piano. Instead, they suggest that I send it to Yamaha.Sending it to Yamaha is going to cost me an additional $27 for shipping--and repair or replacement could take up to 6 weeks--so I am highly dissatisfied. Ordering products online should be as or more convenient than going to an actual store. This experience has proven to me that this is not the case.
__label__2 Proof is searchin' for Jerry Garcia but i have found out who's released the best LP from Shady records this year!: I wasn't expecting quite much because earlier several mixtapes from Proof disappointed me but as i heard this cd i was freaking out!Lyrically pretty perfect i was impressed by the beats: Almost everyone is bangin',''Forgive'' features the Hook of 50's ''Ghetto Qu'ran'' and that fits perfectly! i thought it would be a D12 style,more poppy album but tracks like ''Black wrist bros'' or ''Kurt Kobain'' proved me wrong.One of the best cds this year.''Sammy da bull'' will be played in clubs all the time and Proof can show his skills without the everlasting skills of Eminem, who's only on one track and hasn't produced even one (thank god!).Big Proof Takeover!!!
__label__2 Go Dalmations!: I have Lab & Friends right now but I'm getting it for X-mas!I think the case looks a bit weird with the 3+ thing.I could esially get a Dalmation on my Nintendogs since I have the fireman hat and I could get the Jack Russel with my Jack Russl book, but I'm not in the mood.I have a bunch of Nintendogs Dalmation DS accesories. I have the purse thing and the folio thing.This game is just like the others only with different starter pups.Nintendogs is truely fantastic.The comercial was 100x better than the old one.I don't have the DS lite but I do have a silver, old, DS. If I wanted a DS lite, I would get the white one.I sugest of you getting this game! It's the BEST!It would be cool if they made a Dalamtion Nintendogs themed DS lite...
__label__1 Classic Rock Productions are unethical / but only Mr. Fripp can rectify the root problem.: Every criticism of this DVD is correct, the clips are cut short, their are numerous comments from unknown "experts" that are in no way related to the band, and provide no new insights into the music, and everything is completely unauthorized by the band. However, the band and it's fans will continue to be victimised by poor quality releases such as this unlit Robert Fripp and the band release a quality DVD chonicling Crimson from 1969-1974.
__label__2 Too expensive!: I better not take the risk of buying this CD and finding out is RE-RECORDED!I will have enough with the VYNIL....... May sound SCRATCHY...... But who cares!
__label__2 Very funny again: Just like it's a similar kind of style, but that dosn't make it bad. It makes it very very funny. The animation as and the story is funny and probably the best doulbe act of the age. If you watched Wallace and Gromit before or other aardman programmes/films etc you know what you get and thats lots of fun for familys, children and adults alike. A must buy.
__label__1 Advertisement: This video is essentially an extended advertisement for EarthLink. If you want to use the Internet via Earthlink, this is a good video for you; if you do not, it isn't.
__label__1 Depressing, boring, and disappointing: As a lifelong Frost fan I looked forward to this release and bought it without hearing any of it , but this is a big disappointment.Depressing as hell, I dont know how anyone could listen to this without wanting to commit suicide. I tried to get through the whole album but had to turn it off 3/4 of the way through it.Monotheist has NONE of the uptempo sound of the Frost of old, its all very slow and deliberate, ie: BORING!!!This is too much ART and not enough METAL.
__label__1 Only worth watching on MST3K: The producers have already wasted their time and money on this; don't waste yours! Some of the old MST3K guys have a website called RiffTrax - where they supply running mockery for "big" movies. This turkey was custom made for them. It is the only way that it should be seen by anyone.
__label__1 I agree! Very bad service!: I too ordered "Accenti" by Gucci for women and Macy's also sent "Hugo" Boss for men that is only worth half the price of what I paid (which definitely sounded to good to be true at $57.00 ). At the very least they could have made an effort to send a womens cologne of equal value. This order couldn't have been more off if they tried.
__label__1 Not delivered: I would like to have read the book to write a review. Unfortunately it was never delivered, despite de pre-payment.
__label__2 mudman: the blades are great! I recommend them for fresh water game fish>go buy a case of them today. they will make your fish cleaning much easier.
__label__1 Used DVD: This was a 2 DVD set, advertised as used, but new condition. The bonus DVD was cracked and the DVD of the movie was scratched and skipped and stuck..my daughter was very disappointed that she did not get to watch Lady and the Tramp.
__label__2 The album of 2004: This IS the album of '04. It's so good. I've listened to it 4 times already in one day and I like more every time I listen to it. Buddy's singing is awesome, the guitar hits you like a tidal wave, the lyrics are well written, and you gotta love the double bass beats. Senses Fail is by far the best new band out there. They put on a great live show too. I saw them with Alkaline Trio in May and they were amazing. Keep your eye on this band!
__label__2 Superb!!!: I have had a lot of contact with this band, apart from knowing them personally, I have all of their albums and I could not make my mind if I was forced to choose one. All of them are great (10 so far + a DVD). Contraley is a very special one though. It is a great introduction to the band. If you happen to know spanish, the lyrics (from any of their songs) are also a major plus. It is poetry in every sense of the word. I throughly recomend anything that comes from this band.
__label__2 More happy then not: I like that it was easy to install and works well, only down side is that it looses it connection and i have had to re connect it to my car 2 times now but still a good product.
__label__1 Very one sided.: I felt that Murphy doesn't even try to be balanced. He uses words like "witches brew" and "cauldron" to conjure negative images. Also, the book is somewhat outdated, even though this last reprint was 2005. The most recent information I saw was 1989, and he gives facts that are outdated, including that there is no chickenpox vaccine. Now, all this is coming from a person who is skeptical about vaccines. I just didn't find the book tasteful, or all that helpful. Much better is "The Baccine Book" by Robert W. Sears. He gives facts, but helps you to come to your own decision regarding each individual vaccine rather than making blanket statements about all vaccines.
__label__1 DID NOT WORK!: Shipment was quick as usual and set up was very simple so no complaints there.However this thing does not work.We used it the first time at our cottage and it kept ringing, we went back to the cottage thinking there was something wrong-well there was nothing wrong. So we figured maybe there was a glitch that one time and we decided to give it another try. After 1 week of use, it started phoning us again. ANd yes, it was false alarm again!Overall this was very inconevient for us. We wanted something that we could trust but this alarm kept going off for no reason.I wish I would have spent a bit more and purchased something better.
__label__2 Dogs Love This!: We've had this for over a year now and our dogs still love it. They love to carry around the squirrels. One of the squirrels is showing a little wear on the tail, but they are holding up great (our dogs play tug of war).
__label__1 The ball is PINK!!!: This may be a great soccer ball, but the colors shown are dark blue, green, and red. We received the ball today, and it is white and pink! The ball is for a boy, and somehow I have a feeling he will not like a pink one. I know I could return the ball, but I ordered a different one from a different vendor.If there are other colors of the ball, and there is no choice as to what one receives, please show ALL the colors. If I had known there was a possibility of getting a pink one, I would NEVER have ordered this ball.
__label__1 Too slow for me: I read and loved Father Elijah, Plague Journal and Eclipse of the Sun. They were wonderful, faith-filled, and action-packed Catholic novels. Then I bought Strangers and Sojourners, hoping to continue the action. It started out with a bang, at a satanic ceremony in the main character's childhood. I thought that it would continue from there with more God versus Satan action. No such luck. The story is very slow and just didn't hold my interest. Twice I took breaks to read more interesting novels before continuing with Strangers and Sojourners, then I finally just gave up. I was over 200 pages into the book and still there was very little happening in the woman;s faith and not much action to speak of. It was just too boring for me. I was disappointed with this novel.
__label__1 ouch!: Andrew Manze is an amazing violinist. But he's too amazing for his own good. He doesn't know when to hold back. His frantic sawing of these sonatas is really unpleasant. Where it should be lyrical, he is frenetic. If he could just calm down he is capable of playing beautifully. But not here. A major disappointment.
__label__1 interesting at first, then a total downer: Starts off with a very real depiction of life at the place and time of the novel. That's the interesting part. It slowly devolves into an (spoiler) unappealing read. I found myself asking, why keep reading this, I have better things to do and read. And at the end, an old man with his memories doing futile actions against the modern world. What's the point?
__label__2 A wonderful look into the lives of the endangered.: Being a Science Fiction Comedy writer, Douglas Adams makes learning about endangered species a joy, rather than learning about them from a textbook. Of course, being that his journey took place over twenty years ago, his facts and figures have changed, but this book still gives a great viewpoint into the lives of those that try and save these species. Humor and education combined, for anyone interested, this is a great read.
__label__2 Standard quality product. Good buy.: I have found that this product is right for keeping my brain function sharp. Notice the difference without it. Will recommend and buy this again.
__label__2 WONDERFUL!!: I loved this book! I first got it from my middle school library, and now that I'm in high school I get friends to check it out for me. The story is wonderful, the characters are excellent, and you just fall in love with the whole book. This is one of my favorite books by Oke!
__label__1 this book is not helping me at all: This is a book too complicate for the Flash5 beginers and to easy for the experts.It will make the beginners feel more confusion on the Action Script. And I don't think the Action Sript Masters need to read this.
__label__1 I hate the steel smell!: Everytime I open the cap, there is a strong steel smell coming up! It's so digusting, it even blends with the water. In winter, this bottle can't hold any warmth. The hot water will just conduct through the steel. And the bottle, after using it for two days. It become so dirty, I don't know why, it's just getting sticky. When drinking, water does overflows The mouth is just too big to suit ours!! So when I go outdoor, it's not easily carribale and drinking!For anyone of you, I don't recommend this bottle. It does NOT worth 20 bucks at all!!!! You can just get a 5 dollars transparent plastic bottle that's definitely better than this one!
__label__2 Excellent teaching book: This book highly recommended by my son's guitar teacher, who is getting his Master's degree in classical guitar performance. It doesn't use those beginning songs that are boring to kids. It really keeps their interest and is very thorough. My son (11 yrs) is very happy with it and doesn't ask for my help (that's good ~ cuz I don't play the guitar :-)
__label__1 Pictures are terrible! How about some real role models!!: The pictures and models are terrible. The words are too small and there is too much rambling. I prefer to read weightlifting books that feature the author as the person who is demonstrating the exercises. Such as Bodybuilding A Realistic Approach by Melfa. Or try Bob Paris's Beyond Built. Both of these books are great. I like Melfa's book a little more because all the bodybuilders in his book are amataeurs.
__label__2 Both Beautiful And Sad At The Same Time- A Review By Mary Sanders: Every Chritmas Eve, for as long as I can remember I either watched this classic cartoon with my father, or at my Aunt's Christmas Eve party. I have always loved it, and the story. The animation is clever, and charming.Anyway, this story is about a cute little fawn named Rudolph. It starts out with his birth, and unlike haveing a black nose like the other deer, he has a lovely (at least in my opinion) glowing red nose. His parents are embarassed by him, and try to cover it up with mud to make it appear normal. Later, as he gets a little older, he is shunned by the other deer just for being different. Even Santa Claus hates him (yes, in this movie he is a real mean jerk). But Rudolph's crush-Clarice likes him for who he is. I shall say no more, but this movie carries a strong message: It doesn't matter how great-looking you are on the outside- but how beautiful, and kind you are on the inside. Try it.
__label__2 Throw toy: My dogs love this toy, but be aware it is not a chew toy. It is meant for throw and fetch. It throws well and I prefer it to a frisbee.
__label__2 Attractive and durable product: I like the look of this place set - rather than the unrealistic multi colored ones. My daughter likes them.. plays with them all the time.
__label__2 Pretty good deal: We bought this because of the price. We knew we needed a 2nd remote for the Wii, and this was 10 dollars more than the cost of the remote alone. The games are very simple, and I think in a few more weeks -- maybe months -- the kids (8 and 10 yr old girls) will have gotten bored with them, but 10 dollars for several months worth of entertainment seems to be a pretty good deal.
__label__2 worth is for the first essay alone: What makes this book worth it is the very first essay in the collection, The Glass Essay, a work that is written in verse and that is tinged with the kind of mix of immagination and scholarship that has made Carson's work so popular. By far, however, this is one of her best works. Certainly better than the journeys she has made into poetry exclusively recently. Read this essay before any of her other work and you will have an excellent primer for this evocative writer!
__label__1 the fragrance does not smell right: la fragancia no huele bien me parece que esta como vencidad. no huele como yo esperaba. not if you miss fragrances but I do not like smelling like this
__label__1 Apart from the cliches and the name-dropping, Mrs. Lincoln..: The better parts of this book are a Reader's Digest Condensed version of martial arts philosophy; the rest of it does not rise even to that unambitious level. It is to the original works that it apes as a Superman comic is to Shakespeare. Generously larded with name-dropping, the book represents some of the more profound ideas and principles that have been associated with martial arts in a trivialized, sound-bite form that shortchanges both the reader and the ideas themselves. Despite these deficiences, the book is often praised -- not a surprise, perhaps, given that a sound-bite view of a philosophy may represent much more than the average reader has yet encountered. Is the book easy? Yes. Is the book accessible? Yes. But you need to ask yourself exactly what it is you're getting easy access to. You can do much, much better than this.
__label__2 Looking For the Best of, really is the best of Hasselhunk !!: I bought this CD for my mom, and she LOVES it !!She plays it everyday !!I also like it a lot. David sounds very sexy singing in French and in German. His music is very refreshing and upbeat!! We plan to buy even more of his music, all that we can find !!!
__label__2 "Experimentally Technologitized": I read this book a while ago... I don't remember much about it right now, but I think it was okay. It's a book about controlling a person's mental disease with computer-controlled electrodes, but didn't turn out to be such a good idea. Poor guy...!Yet another one of Crichton's thriller.
__label__1 The most uninspiring text-book I've personally experienced as a student: After reading this textbook one might decide hang him/herself out of sheer despair to ever be able to follow the logic of the conclusions and assumptions presented by the authors. Nevermind mistakes, lack of explanations of seemingly incosistent statements (perceived, perhaps, but that says enough about the clarity of the writing), ostensible deficit of insight and dull presentation... Thankfully, my professor did a much better job during the lectures and hopefully managed to salvage some credibility of the field and preserve students' interest in behavioral theories.I am not sure if there are alternatives to this textbook out there, but they are definitely needed. Considering the quality of my other textbooks on various academic subject including psychology, this was a very unpleasant surprise... quite inhibitive, CS+.
__label__2 Great sync/charge cable.: The cable pictured is a hot sync cable and a charger at the same time. The sync function is fast and doesn't get interrupted like it does on my original cable. You can charge your Treo 600 from the same cable, and therefore it will charge up directly from the USB port of any computer. This is just great for me because I can now charge the phone straigth from my laptop when I'm out and have one less cord to drag around. The adapters for the wall or cigarette lighter accessory outlet in a car make it all the more convenient. I have not used the adapters much though, so I'm not sure how well they perform.Over all I vastly prefer the sync/charge cable over the original gear that came with my Treo 600 and heartily recommend it to all for their use.
__label__1 this is garbage: first of all, the right wing opened way more than the left. the stabilizer broke off in midflight. it shot straight up, then fluttered down like a helpless broken helicopter. after a few times we could no longer lock the wings in place. age 11
__label__1 Good games -- if you can play them: This product has some worthwhile educational games. But they must be launched from the disk. Some of the games launch, while others do not (I have a machine running Vista running program compatibility with Win95). Many of these titles are shareware/freeware types, so have even more limited playability.
__label__2 Angel Creek by Linda Howard.: I found Angel Creek interesting from beginning to end. The decription of the land made you feel like you were there. The characters were very likeable. But then again I love all of Linda Howards books.
__label__2 Letters from a Porcupine: Erie, yet well done. It's almost like taking a trip back into the past whenever you want, only your living life with the band. This DVD shows every moment of the bands life that MTV didn't. It's well done and well put together. Think of it as a must have keepsake of a great band that didn't even see their prime yet.
__label__2 Valuable and grounded Christian marriage book: This book was assigned to us for pre-marriage counseling and we both found it to be encouraging, challenging, and worthwhile. It is thankfully concise at 160 pages but is also deep. My guess is this will be something I'll be referring to over and over again...
__label__2 Excellent: It is the perfect bible for teenagers. Teenagers now a days have a lot of questions about the contents of the bible & this bible comes with the answers! With historical notes & fun facts inserted, this bible makes it fun to read it!
__label__2 tremendous game: One of the best console style action games ever. Well thought out storyline that dominates gameplay, marred by a few ridiculous sub plots. Very serious ending that is a real surprise. The game play elements pay homage to past Metal gear games, while adding to them and making them better. Some of the codec transmits were too frequent and a bit winded. Real shocker ending is very philosphical in it's direction, very clever. Basically a japanese anime with a very serious storyline, that has you playing intermediate scenes in the middle in order to find out how it ends!This game is very impressive and obviously had some of the best talent working on it, it's amazing!!
__label__2 Best. Album. Ever.: I love it. Go Montreal! Very, very catchy songs.Fav songs:All Men Fear Women...: The title is so true. So are the lyrics.Too Much Attitude: Great lyrics and trumpit.Holiday: "Holiday... Away from you! Holiday... Away from you!"Surfin' in Tofino: Real, real catchy.Life of the Party: Awesome brass on this track.All the other songs.The CD rules, buy it now. Check out Planet Smasher's "Mighty" as well.
__label__1 Broken: I also thought the projection was blurry. Too blurry to even draw anything. After just a few months the light went out so I changed it. It comes with an extra one. It worked for a little longer and doesn't work at all now. I also changed the batteries. Still doesn't work anymore. I don't recommend it.
__label__1 the music is okay, but the gimic bothers me.: T.A.T.U., I don't quite know what to do with you. I actually enjoy the music, not despite or because of the "gimick" ..., but I enjoyed the sound of the group before I comprehended the words or saw the video. Now I myself quite enjoy the idea of girls in love,... But when it comes to this subject, I like to see the subject of teenage [relationships] handled more delicatly. Because otherwise it's just feeding into the latest fad. ...
__label__2 Very Nice...: Omarion came back pretty strong this time around. Most of the songs on this album are definitely standout songs. The production is flawless and lyrics are nicely written and arranged too. Although, I wouldn't expect deep lyrics from Omarion, he has seriously surpassed his first album "O"! My favs on this album are Do It, Midnight, Electric, Obsession, IceBox, Entourage and The Truth! I like a couple others but don't remember the names. LOL. Good job this time around!
__label__1 Terrible, overpriced: Upfront I want to say that this grinder does a nice job of grinding coffee beans evenly - all the coffee comes out about the same "fineness" or "coarseness" depending on how you set it. This is a good thing, and if you have ever used the really basic coffee grinders, you know they can't do this.However, its a pain to use this grinder. The receptical for the ground coffee doesn't seal well and coffee grounds get spilled, making a mess. Its also possible to start the grinder without seating the receptical, so that none of the coffee goes in the receptical and ALL of it goes spewing into your kitchen. To make things even worse, my receptical cracked - the plastic is just not very sturdy. And I can find out how to get a replacement. I would suggest either going cheaper and getting a basic Krups grinder, or spending a lot more and getting something more on the industrial strength variety. As another reviewer wrote, its a pity that a good grinder can't be had in this price range.
__label__2 Michael W. Smith's "This is Your Time": "This is Your Time" had touching lyrics that pierced the midst of your heart and soul. The title cut brings chills of challenge up your spine. "I Will Be Your Friend" was another hit. "Hey You, It's Me" had great lyrics to it as well. The only fault I could find with the album in itself is that Smith's musical background in most of the songs sounded too much like some of his older stuff. "Worth It All" and "I Will Carry You" are two examples. Other than that, if you favor contemporary Christian music, I think you'll love "This is Your Time."
__label__2 A pleasant, fun read!!: I never would have read this book e/x for my book club, and so glad I did!! I've been living in Rome for the past 1 1/2 years, so I just loved reading about Julia's experience with living overseas and her falling in love with French food and cooking. The writing was fantastic -- I felt like I could hear Julia talking; hear the vendors at the markets selling their wares; hear the waves slapping on the port where their apartment was in Marseilles, and smell the countryside of their home, LaPeetch, in France. I so enjoyed Julia's honesty as well, with her collaborators, her relationship with her father, her sister, Dort. It truly was a joyous read!
__label__1 Poor design and quality: A pin broke after about 5 uses, the nuts and bolts are constently needing tighting, and if you are trying to cut something bigger at 1/2 inch there is a good chance the handels will cometogether smashing your fingers. Do not buy these.
__label__1 batteries were not included: bought this as a christmas present, but decided to keep it. so just opened it today.will have to review this product later..as the 2 AA batteries were NOT included.one * for that great annoyance.
__label__1 My hair is falling out from this dryer!: I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it. I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one. After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it. Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out. It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before. I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair! Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower. Please stay away from this dryer! I'm glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn't surprise me.
__label__2 Car accident: Eight months ago, when I first used this t-shirt I had a slight incident. I was driving when a group of Hell's Angels passed by. One of them accidentally scratched the door and they all stopped. Mad Al, the guy at the bike appologized and offered to pay the cost of a new paintjob. Now they all stop by every saturday to wash my car.
__label__1 Not satisfied: I bought this for my grandaughter and was so surprised at how little came with it. I kept looking inside the box for more. It's really only a carrying case, that doesn't hold much of anything. I wouldn't spend $5 on this. Don't waste your money. Even the strawberry shortcake dolls that go with this are overpriced. Save your money and don't buy this!!!
__label__2 Utility Cart # DC100: The cart is pretty good and it does fold so it's fairly easy to store in a closet. My problem with it is the handle is not long enough. The handle should be at least a foot longer.My first choice was a standard hand truck but nothing was available at the time in my price range.
__label__2 Best shadow laugh in video. Great villian, the black tiger.: While not completely true to the pulps, this is a very entertaining serial. Victor Jory has the moves down and the laugh. Laugh is much better than the Alec Baldwin modern version. The Black Tiger is one of the best gimmick villians ever. Several clever scenes and some campy ones. I taught my african grey parrot the shadow laugh in two days by playing the tape multiple times. Classic video.....jack welch
__label__1 HO2 Error strikes again: I have had this DVD player for almost 18 months. After 1 month I got an H02 error, Called Panasonic for help and got the worst customer service I have ever experienced, all they would provide is the address to authorized service centers. Sent it in and got it repaired under warranty (about 3 weeks to get it back). Now after a year the H02 error strikes again, no longer under warranty I am going to junk it. Look at other reviews (epinions, etc..) This H02 error is all over, I will never buy another Panasonic product. If not for the errors the product worked fine and would appear to be a good value.

__label__2 Great Deal: I was reluctant to buy this based on the one review that was negative but took the chance since there were some others that said it was ok. I was pleasantly surprised...worked perfectly, felt solid, went through a few hundred nails the first day without any problems. For the price it is a great deal.
__label__2 Hav Plenty is one of my top five movies of all time!!!: the first time i saw this movie it was by pure chance. i had no idea as to what to expect... talk about finding a diamond in the rough. it was brilliantly written, directed, and the acting was perfect. in watching the movie, you feel as if you are in the story as a silent witness to this amazingly funny and sometimes weird story. to me, this is a cult classic... even if i am the only person in the cult.
__label__1 lost interest: I rarely stop reading a book once I start but I lost interest in this one after getting about 1/4 of the way into it. I kept hoping it would get better. Maybe it's me or the Japanese locations (I know nothing about Japan) but it just wasn't for me.
__label__2 A bunch of whinners ...........: The software is intuitive. If you don't like the supplied clipart ....... use your own. I've used the supplied software for over a year and prefer it over all others I've used. It allows use of any font. It allows scalable rounding of text. The complaint about graininess is caused by trying to enlarge an image too much. There are limits. I do multiple disc set sometimes and this software allows me to easily mark disc numbers. The labels themselves are opaque enough to hide most manufacturers pre-printed labels. If you are not happy with this product, you won't be happy with any other either.
__label__1 Sounded pretty good in 1999: Some of the cuts on this CD were almost hypnotic when I first heard them nearly 10 years ago. But what do I know; if I had to guess I would say that 10 years further on this will be a collectors item and very hard to find, either in shops or on Amazon
__label__2 Give yourself a break and get it together!: A positive, practical way to love yourself and bring order to your daily world. It's a simple approach, that does not cling to hard and fast rules. It will give you practical ideas and practical ways to implement them, if you choose to do so. Always encouraging you along the way, the ideas for organizing your home and cleaning routines spill over into everyday life. It's about attitude, baby steps, and caring for yourself enough to make positive changes. Sprinkled with humor, first hand accounts of "then and now", and reader responses with results. It's a short read that you'll refer to time and again.
__label__1 Difficult and boring: Cute idea from the original Giga pets, but these newer ones are a pain in the butt to take care of. You cannot feed or take care of your pet until you have enough money to buy food or the supplies it needs, and digging for the right amount of money takes hours. It's been awhile since I've used this, but I don't recall the instructions being too detailed, and I was confused on what I should 'do'. I don't remember there being a goal with these pets like there is with original Giga Pets and tamagotchis (I.E. growing up, changing). The Tomcat will always be a tomcat...digging for lost treasure. Very boring. I did not buy this from amazon (or seller)
__label__1 Disappointing...: After listening to Rio, Notorious and the Wedding album (their three best ones), this album is a disappointment for me. There are some great efforts on it (Pop trash movie, Mars meets Venus, Somebody else not me) but the rest is not remarkable. It seems that they try to find a new style in a new kind of music, which David Bowie had made years before with Earthling. But unfortunately that was better than this one. I hope that Duran returns to his roots, the new wave and funky line and leaves this futuristic sillinness behind on their next album, cause it's not Duran Duran anymore.
__label__1 disappointing: I purchased this album after reading all the reviews on here saying that its a masterpiece. I dont really hear much of this in the music, in fact i find it to be quite bland if not irritating. There are few good songs, but the singer's voice kills them. It's like the band is trying to hard to be something they cant be. Musically it is very simple. If I were you I'd pass on getting this album and check out other bands like the microphones or olivia tremor control. I spent 12 bucks on this album that I'll probably only listen to a couple more times. All the songs sound alot alike and they lack complexity. It's like the quitarist only knows how to do cheesy chords. i dont consider it to be very emotional at all like alot of people who reviewed it. It's really just a bunch of badly written songs with a singer who is painfull to listen to. if this is what you look for in music than by all means buy the album. one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time.
__label__2 Gift of Time: Watch is nice looking and reasonably priced. The watch is a gift to be given and at this time, the operation of the same is unknown.
__label__2 Excellent phone. Good speaker phone capabilities.: Works excellent. Good range. Both the base station and handset speaker phone options work very well. Loud, clear and picks up my voice well.
__label__2 Good book: Good book, covers the often used differential equations. The stuffs covered in this book are pretty useful for me (I'm an Electrical Engineer).
__label__2 Fond Memories: This takes me back to when I was a kid. I always enjoyed the Rankin & Bass shows.I didn't remember this until I watched it with my niece.The Rankin & Bass Christmas shows are on yearly so they are more easily remembered. It is a cute way to watch the Hans Christain Anderson tales.
__label__2 does what it was intended to do.: been a year. it gives my car a little more kick to it on the freeway, but it also lowered my gas mileage a little. it was expected.lowers intake manifold temp a little. but ambient engine bay temperature negates any difference it would have made.
__label__2 Best Vacuum I Have Had: I love this vacuum. It was cheap and it does a great job. It has incredibly good suction. I have had more expensive vacuums in the past and they didn't work as well as this one does. I have recommended this vacuum to a few people, one of which has purchased it and loves it as much as I do.
__label__1 Compatibility: This extender is not compatible with the Canon EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS. The Canon web site and this site leads you to believe that it is compatible. Granted the 18-200 is a new lense, but none of the compatibility charts address this lense/extender combination. I had to return the product.
__label__1 Pfizer Pet-Tabs VS. Virbac Pet-Tabs: I find it very odd that there are two different manufacturers of "Pet-Tabs" and their labeling is practically identical: Pfizer and Virbac. I'm not sure how that is legal. If I buy "Pet-Tabs" from my vet, they're always Pfizer, but when I ordered these I realized they were quite different and didn't know why until I realized they were made by Virbac. The Pfizer tablets seem to be of higher quality--moister, denser consistency, darker color. Overall, fresher. The Virbac ones are paler, dryer and more powdery when broken apart. Buyer beware...
__label__1 The worst book I have ever read: I wish I didn't even have to give this book 1 star. It doesn't deserve that. I don't know who wrote the back summary of the book, but that person completely misrepresented it. This was a completely childish, poorly written piece of sholck that I read for my book club. We all hated it. It was truly awful. There is no "message for dreamers, cynics, belivers and sceptics" or any one. Do not pay money for this book. I can't warn you enough that the book description is NOTHING like the book itself. Don't be fooled as we were that this was a book worth reading.
__label__2 This book tells the secret that cannot be told.: I have read many books on self improvement and spirituality. This book is the only one I would keep if I were being sent to a desert island. It is different than others in that it carries you gently and subtlely into your own awakening. If you read the book more than once you will read an entirely different book. This book changes your understanding of life, psychology and consciousness. Enjoy!!
__label__1 Disappointing cookbook: Like others we were surprised to find that the recipes were predominantly very unhealthy. Our toddler loves mac n cheese as most do and we thought that this would help us find healthier alternatives but it does not. We are so displeased that we are returning it to Amazon.
__label__1 We don't want it: A great record -- if you're into hearing teenage girls screaming. If, on the other hand, you'd like to hear the Rolling Stones play live, go buy Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out.
__label__1 con job: I can't review the product as I have never received it! I received an unsealed dvd case of the movie without a dvd in it and no invoice. I sent it back immediately and received $1.36 for the postage. Nearly a month after ordering, I haven't received the refund from the unethical clowns at Import CD Specialists.
__label__1 My ears are bleeding: This cartoon is why so many adults hate 'cartoons.' If you're going to do a show about Sonic in a BAND and hire only one voice actor, why not hire one who can actually sing? They do exist.Painful to listen to, with an animation quality that's equally painful to watch.Possibly the worst drivel the Sonic series has ever produced, and considering some of the lemons they've been willing to slap Sonic's name on, that is saying something.Too bad I will probably have to buy the rest of the series for a young family member, since for some reason, kids too young to have developed taste beyond 'it's animated' love the bad singing and washed out, pathetic excuses for a plot. It barely fits into the rest of the Sonic shows- was probably developed to have other main characters and they slapped Sonic into it just so someone would actually watch it. It'd never have sold without a major character glued on.If your kids haven't seen it, don't let them get started on it. Your ears will thank you.
__label__1 too much of a bargain?: The quality of sound for $19.99 is just fine. However, I've had the product only two weeks and I need to arrange to send it back for a replacement. The tiny clasp that tightens the thin headband has no tension in it, so it can't be shaped to fit my head. And now something is wrong with the electronics: 5 to 20 minutes after turning it on, a growling/buzzing sound appears in the background and grows gradually louder until it drowns out the music.
__label__2 An Incredibly Beautiful Book: I was given this book as a present and have now read it over ten times. Lovely images and good mathematics. Lundy covers the numbers 1-12 in detail, listing their relationships to music, geometry and Pythagorean number theory, as well as some cultural background. She does this without sounding either too 'symbolic' or too 'mathematical'. Each number is presented with its own compound illustration, and these are - to put it plainly - quite awesomely well executed. The book then goes off into Magic Squares, Gematria and other esoterica again managing to stay neat, informative and historical. Finally there are extensive appendices. I utterly commend this rare, beautiful and fascinating book to anyone with even a passing interest in numbers.
__label__1 Thought the Title was the Only Clever Line: I was very much looking forward to reading Landvik since I had heard many good things. Alas, my fellow amazon reviewers misled me. Yuck. I thought the book was pitifully underwritten, with shallow and extremely contrived characters. I found most of the humor to be insulting and the overall plot to be vain and simpering. I am hoping that "Patty Jane" is better, but I don't think I am up to reading it, just in case. I am deeply disturbed that Landvik is recommended in the same group as Michael Lee West. West is so superior to Landvik--as a story teller, as a satirist, as a slice-of-life writer--that the two should never be mentioned again in the same sentence.
__label__1 Nice book but it left me wanting more, too skimpy.: First of all the format is way, way too small, what was there was nice but I wanted to see more of everything, more recipes, more historical photos, more contemporary photos of the interiors, some advertising and graphic design would have been nice, I came away unsatisfied. Perhaps the author didn't have access to alot of the archival materials since it was going to be sold off to FDS. BOO!
__label__1 Horrible: Don't use this book to review or learn physics. It's pathetic. Concets are not clear; the topics are explained in vague words, instead of rigorous mathematical logics. Don't buy it unless you just want to solve some problems. I recommend AP Physics from Princeton Review, which is good for you to both learn physics and prepare SAT2 and AP exams.
__label__1 Completely AWFUL!!: This product is HORRID! I loaded it, and my internet connection was shut off by it, and none of the 'trditional' way of getting it started worked. I called Panda, Microsoft (who couldnt help, as it was 3rd party software that caused my problems), Panda again, and nothing from anyone. Horrible customer service, Horrible product.Buyer Beware!!You are hereby warned!DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL PROGRAM!!!Norton is the way to go...FOR SURE!!!
__label__2 PEDRO FERNANDEZ ES FANTASTICO.: PEDRO TIENE UNA VOZ TAN LINDA Y BELLA. RECOMIENDO ESTE CD PORQUE TIENE UNAS CANCIONES BIEN LINDAS, Y SU MARIACHI ES FANTASTICO, LO MEJOR DE MEXICO. CON MUCHO AMOR......................................................
__label__1 Geronimo's story of his life: I figured that this book would go into greater detail about the famous Apache Indian Geronimo. Since it did not that is why I gave it a two star rating.
__label__2 Tons of info. but could use a more precise index.: Tons of information and I understand that organizing such a wealth of knowledge is a daunting task. I found that I was flipping around to find the infomation where I thought I had seen it previously and the index was not very helpful there. References are made to other sections of the book but states a chapter only and not a page specifically. Overall, great book and have used it alot for a reference.
__label__1 Video Cards: This program did not work with my video card. Buyers are well advised to check the Microsoft site to see if the program will work with their video card. There are a number of them that it won't work with. I couldn't even get the patch to work.
__label__2 A Must Read!: I really enjoyed reading this book. I always want to enter into a world of other than just sex and usual story plots. This book allows one to get in touch with their spiritual side. I could relate to a lot of what Chantell was going through in this book. It makes you want to stop what you are doing and remember to put God first in all that you do because it is through Him that all blessings come. Really wonderful book....I look forward to reading more books from this author.
__label__1 Forgettable buddy movie that has its moments.: Forgettable buddy movie that has it moments of sincerity thanks to Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn , whose chemistry is better than this really bad film that does not know what it really wants to be. Martin Lawrence is ok but overreacts way too much, and Steve Zahn is pretty good but is really giving nothing more to do than to react to Lawrence's stupidity. Eric Roberts hits a new career low as the heavy, and really does not do anything more than try to look menacing and the action scenes are so way over the top that it becomes ridiculous in certain places and in times way out of place. It would have been a better film if they had a script than made some sense and focus more on the chemistry of the two actors other than to make a very bad film with nothing for them to do.
__label__1 Format is dying-dont buy unless you know what you are getting: Early January 08 Warner Bros. Switch to support Blue Ray only. Effectively signing a death sentence of all HD-DVD players on the basis that now most studies support Blue Ray. Do not buy unless, you have a HD-DVD library you need to support, HD-DVD format gets a reprieve later on (very doubtful), or you just have money to burn and dont care. Other HD-DVD players might still be a good buy because they still play old DVDs and upconverts so as a regular upconverting DVDs they may still be good, although still overpriced.
__label__2 hugh grant and sandra bullock are a perfect match...: a delightful romnatic comedy..Hugh Grant plays a very public playboy....sandra bullock is a attonery for the underdog...Hugh grant needs an lawyer and sandra needs hugh's help to save a community center so she works for him thinking it's a great oppurnity..but it soon turns out to be a nightmare when sandra finds herself being more like his servant than his legal advisor..so she gives him his two weeks notice..but they soon find out they have more than just work and friendship in common ...
__label__1 Component Output does not work (Two Units): The component Output did not work on an original unit I ordered and on a replacement unit that was sent. There is a serious flaw with units of recent manufacture. I Own the same unit that was purchased in 2003 and it has performed flawlessly.Serious Quality Control Problem!!!
__label__2 Martin Rosen has done it again!: This person should really get his hands on more projects! The reality of his animation style is superb. The movie follows the book as closely as one can when binded by a time limit. This movie should go to DVD right away and join its brother "Watership Down".
__label__2 Fiction & Folklore: Witch Child is a 'junior' read, but very entertaining. This has been on my list for years, and was not a dissappointment. Written as a diary, 14 yr old Mary leaves her home after her grandmother is hung for being a witch, and travels to the New World in the 1600s to start life anew with a woman she has never met.Their travel is long upon a boat, and her she starts to discover her true talents as a witch; and the struggle to keep her identity a secret.In the New World her struggle grows to hide her secrets and her relationship that develops with the Native Americans. And ultimately, she is blamed for situations she did not committ.This book is an easy read, in journal form, and is very entertaining and heart wrenching.I reccommend to anyone who enjoy's reading witchcraft-lore & fiction combined.
__label__2 Shipping kills the savings: With shipping cost, this product is about $10 per bottle of 500. Not a bad price, but the same thing at WalMart is just under $8 per bottle ($7.97 I think). So you pay an extra $4 for the convenience of having delivery to your door. This disparity can be reduced by ordering more than one unit, which is two bottles of 500, at a time. Check the postage chart the company supplies, do the math, and it could be worth your time. Of course this only works if you are a heavy and regular user of ibuprofen. Still a way better buy than name brands no matter what you do. No sense paying for the Motrin or Advil name when this product is the same thing. The seller has so far proved to be reliable and prompt. Too bad they can't be more reasonable with their shipping charges.
__label__2 A great choice for me!: When I decided to get a pedometer, I researched the reviews and decided on the Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer because of the reviews praising its accuracy and sturdy construction.I am very happy with my choice! It is all that was promised. I especially appreciate the clearly visible display, which includes a clock, so I don't lose track of time!
__label__1 Fail me Two times!: The first one dead in 48 hours.The second dead in two days.The third one, ..., not a chance, order canceled. No charge at all! Thx Amazon.
__label__2 Oooh yes!: I own and have seen this movie probably four or five times now. It is what turned me on to the fabulous actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. Of course James Spader plays his usual villainous role. It's definitely not your run of the mill love story but well worth the watch.
__label__2 Passages:Photographs in Africa: Great large format whole page images, some of which were presented in the two volume hardback "Ceremonies". Beautiful people, cultures and images for a great price. I hope the traditions of our world never never leave us. A beautiful book.
__label__1 Did not work with Wii U: Tried it with Wii U, picture was black and white rather than color, returning it. Don't know if not compatible with Wii U or got a bad cable.
__label__2 love it: Love the idea!! Very interesting, i am excited to read the rest of the books in the series! very good
__label__2 Fast-moving: This is a fast moving mystery where murder takes second place to a whole series of robberies. An intriguing story, though I was disappointed that I had to delve through 80% of the book before any murder took place. Miss Marple herself also plays second fiddle to some Scotland Yard detective. She renders help, but it is not clear that the cops couldn't solve it without her.
__label__2 Fun to play: I thought this game was pretty cool. It had a cool story to it, and it had great graphics. The best part about it is it's gameplay,you can switch between third and first person. I also thought that the levels had a perfect Terminator atmosphere. I highly recommend this game over T3:Rise of the Machines(which sucks).
__label__2 a man driven to complete a task: Great movie. Some may find it slow and its not colorful. A really good story though. I enjoyed it. Denzel & Oldman do great work here. Now I wish I could buy a machete like that :) It feels like a modern day "mad max" IMOBTW: I rented it on BD and it wasnt too impressive picture/sound wise, so it may look just as good on DVD for less -if you wanted to buy
__label__1 Can I give it ZERO stars: movie sucked, plain and simple.Kaboom sucked as well.Folks can form their own opinion after watching it but I would give this and Kaboom Negative stars if I could.I almost feel the director should pay me for wasting time watching his junk.
__label__1 Poor quality and design: The rubber armor around the objective lens came off the day that I received it. It was held on by two very small dabs of glue which did not adhere to the rubber at all. The rubber piece was very loose fitting and would not stay on without adhesive. The body under the rubber is metal (aluminum?), but somewhat thin-walled. The eyepiece adjustment ring also loosened with initial use and appears to be made of cheap plastic materials. The unit is definitely not waterproof, and likely not splash resistant. The eyecup folds down for use with eyeglasses, but it makes little difference because it has such short eye relief making it uncomfortable to use. The high magnification, narrow field of view, and dim optics make for a poor viewing experience.
__label__2 Great Book!: This is an amazing book. Not only does it have the translation of the New Testament, but the author has also included many of his personal studies on issues like the "Trinity" and "Christmas". The author is a believer himself and has done a lot of research in order to get us the best translation of the New Testament possible. I recommend this book to all who want to learn more about God's word!
__label__2 Not the best of Terry Brooks: Don't get me wrong...I love Terry Brooks (most of my copies are autographed), but I don't think this is the best of his books.In reading past novels, you get the impression of a man with a vision of an alternate world. You get the feeling that he took his time to masterfully craft the story. Not here.In a few places in the book, I get the feeling that the author didn't thoroughly reread the work. I don't want to give away anything from the story, but in one instance, a character "absorbs" some sickness and passes out. In the next paragraph, someone is going to talk to them. How can this happen with that person being unconscious? Maybe I am nitpicking, but I got this sense in more than a couple of places.I would still read this book and recommend it for all Terry Brooks fans, but this is not a book for the first time reader of Terry Brooks.
